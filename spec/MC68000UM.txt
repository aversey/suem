                                  All the processors are basically the same with the exception of the MC68008. The
                                  MC68008 differs from the others in that the data bus size is eight bits, and the address
                                  range is smaller. The MC68010 has a few additional instructions and instructions that
                                  operate differently than the corresponding instructions of the other devices.

                                  1.1   MC68000
                                  The MC68000 is the first implementation of the M68000 16/-32 bit microprocessor
                                  architecture. The MC68000 has a 16-bit data bus and 24-bit address bus while the full
                                  architecture provides for 32-bit address and data buses. It is completely code-compatible
                                  with the MC68008 8-bit data bus implementation of the M68000 and is upward code
                                  compatible with the MC68010 virtual extensions and the MC68020 32-bit implementation
                                  of the architecture. Any user-mode programs using the MC68000 instruction set will run
                                  unchanged on the MC68008, MC68010, MC68020, MC68030, and MC68040. This is
                                  possible because the user programming model is identical for all processors and the
                                  instruction sets are proper subsets of the complete architecture.

                                  1.2   MC68008
                                  The MC68008 is a member of the M68000 family of advanced microprocessors. This

                                  device allows the design of cost-effective systems using 8-bit data buses while providing
                                  the benefits of a 32-bit microprocessor architecture. The performance of the MC68008 is
                                  greater than any 8-bit microprocessor and superior to several 16-bit microprocessors.

                                  The MC68008 is available as a 48-pin dual-in-line package (plastic or ceramic) and 52-pin
                                  plastic leaded chip carrier. The additional four pins of the 52-pin package allow for
                                  additional signals: A20, A21, BGACK, and IPL2. The 48-pin version supports a 20-bit
                                  address that provides a 1-Mbyte address space; the 52-pin version supports a 22-bit
                                  address that extends the address space to 4 Mbytes. The 48-pin MC68008 contains a
                                  simple two-wire arbitration circuit; the 52-pin MC68008 contains a full three-wire MC68000
                                  bus arbitration control. Both versions are designed to work with daisy-chained networks,
                                  priority encoded networks, or a combination of these techniques.

                                  A system implementation based on an 8-bit data bus reduces system cost in comparison
                                  to 16-bit systems due to a more effective use of components and byte-wide memories and
                                  peripherals. In addition, the nonmultiplexed address and data buses eliminate the need for
                                  external demultiplexers, further simplifying the system.

                                  The large nonsegmented linear address space of the MC68008 allows large modular
                                  programs to be developed and executed efficiently. A large linear address space allows
                                  program segment sizes to be determined by the application rather than forcing the
                                  designer to adopt an arbitrary segment size without regard to the application's individual
                                  requirements.

                                  The MC68010 utilizes VLSI technology and is a fully implemented 16-bit microprocessor
                                  with 32-bit registers, a rich basic instruction set, and versatile addressing modes. The
                                  vector base register (VBR) allows the vector table to be dynamically relocated

                                  SECTION 2
                                  INTRODUCTION
                                  The section provide a brief introduction to the M68000 microprocessors (MPUs).
                                  Detailed information on the programming model, data types, addressing modes, data
                                  organization and instruction set can be found in M68000PM/AD, M68000 Programmer's
                                  Reference Manual. All the processors are identical from the programmer's viewpoint,
                                  except that the MC68000 can directly access 16 Mbytes (24-bit address) and the

                                  MC68008 can directly access 1 Mbyte (20-bit address on 48-pin version or 22-bit
                                  address on 52-pin version). The MC68010, which also uses a 24-bit address, has much
                                  in common with the other devices; however, it supports additional instructions and
                                  registers and provides full virtual machine/memory capability. Unless noted, all
                                  information pertains to all the M68000 MPUs.


                                  2.1    PROGRAMMER'S MODEL
                                  All the microprocessors executes instructions in one of two modes—user mode or
                                  supervisor mode. The user mode provides the execution environment for the majority of
                                  application programs. The supervisor mode, which allows some additional instructions
                                  and privileges, is used by the operating system and other system software.

                                  2.1.1 User' Programmer's Model
                                  The user programmer's model (see Figure 2-1) is common to all M68000 MPUs. The
                                  user programmer's model, contains 16, 32-bit, general-purpose registers (D0–D7, A0–
                                  A7), a 32-bit program counter, and an 8-bit condition code register. The first eight
                                  registers (D0–D7) are used as data registers for byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), and long-word
                                  (32-bit) operations. The second set of seven registers (A0–A6) and the user stack pointer
                                  (USP) can be used as software stack pointers and base address registers. In addition,
                                  the address registers can be used for word and long-word operations. All of the 16
                                  registers can be used as index registers.

                                  2.1.2 Supervisor Programmer's Model
                                  The supervisor programmer's model consists of supplementary registers used in the
                                  supervisor mode. The M68000 MPUs contain identical supervisor mode register
                                  resources, which are shown in Figure 2-2, including the status register (high-order byte)
                                  and the supervisor stack pointer (SSP/A7').

                                  The supervisor programmer's model supplement of the MC68010 is shown in Figure 2-
                                  3. In addition to the supervisor stack pointer and status register, it includes the vector
                                  base register (VRB) and the alternate function code registers (AFC).The VBR is used to
                                  determine the location of the exception vector table in memory to support multiple vector

                                  The 14 flexible addressing modes, shown in Table 2-1, include six basic types:
                                    1. Register Direct
                                    2. Register Indirect
                                    3. Absolute
                                    4. Immediate

                                  The eight data registers support data operands of 1, 8, 16, or 32 bits. The seven address
                                  registers and the active stack pointer support address operands of 32 bits.

                                  2.3.1 Data Registers
                                  Each data register is 32 bits wide. Byte operands occupy the low-order 8 bits, word
                                  operands the low-order 16 bits, and long-word operands, the entire 32 bits. The least
                                  significant bit is addressed as bit zero; the most significant bit is addressed as bit 31.

                                                                      Go to: www.freescale.com

                                  When a data register is used as either a source or a destination operand, only the
                                  appropriate low-order portion is changed; the remaining high-order portion is neither
                                  used nor changed.

                                  2.3.2 Address Registers
                                  Each address register (and the stack pointer) is 32 bits wide and holds a full, 32-bit
                                  address. Address registers do not support byte-sized operands. Therefore, when an
                                  address register is used as a source operand, either the low-order word or the entire
                                  long-word operand is used, depending upon the operation size. When an address
                                  register is used as the destination operand, the entire register is affected, regardless of
                                  the operation size. If the operation size is word, operands are sign-extended to 32 bits
                                  before the operation is performed.

                                  2.4    DATA ORGANIZATION IN MEMORY
                                  Bytes are individually addressable. As shown in Figure 2-5, the high-order byte of a
                                  word has the same address as the word. The low-order byte has an odd address, one
                                  count higher. Instructions and multibyte data are accessed only on word (even byte)
                                  boundaries. If a long-word operand is located at address n (n even), then the second
                                  word of that operand is located at address n+2.

                                  The data types supported by the M68000 MPUs are bit data, integer data of 8, 16, and
                                  32 bits, 32-bit addresses, and binary-coded-decimal data. Each data type is stored in
                                  memory as shown in Figure 2-6. The numbers indicate the order of accessing the data
                                  from the processor. For the MC68008 with its 8-bit bus, the appearance of data in
                                  memory is identical to the all the M68000 MPUs. The organization of data in the memory
                                  of the MC68008 is shown in Figure 2-7.

                                  MC68000, the MC68HC000 and the MC68010), Figure 3-2 ( for the MC68HC001), Figure
                                  3-3 (for the MC68EC000), Figure 3-4 (for the MC68008, 48-pin version), and Figure 3-5
                                  (for the MC68008, 52-pin version). The following paragraphs provide brief descriptions of

                                               The terms assertion and negation are used extensively in this
                                               manual to avoid confusion when describing a mixture of
                                               "active-low" and "active-high" signals. The term assert or
                                               assertion is used to indicate that a signal is active or true,
                                               independently of whether that level is represented by a high or
                                               low voltage. The term negate or negation is used to indicate
                                               that a signal is inactive or false.

                                  Address Bus (A23–A0)
                                   This 24-bit, unidirectional, three-state bus is capable of addressing 16 Mbytes of data.
                                   This bus provides the address for bus operation during all cycles except interrupt
                                   acknowledge cycles and breakpoint cycles. During interrupt acknowledge cycles,
                                   address lines A1, A2, and A3 provide the level number of the interrupt being
                                   acknowledged, and address lines A23–A4 and A0 are driven to logic high. In 16-Bit
                                   mode, A0 is always driven high.

                                  MC68008 Address Bus
                                   The unidirectional, three-state buses in the two versions of the MC68008 differ from
                                   each other and from the other processor bus only in the number of address lines and
                                   the addressing range. The 20-bit address (A19–A0) of the 48-pin version provides a 1-
                                   Mbyte address space; the 52-pin version supports a 22-bit address (A21–A0), extending

                                   the address space to 4 Mbytes. During an interrupt acknowledge cycle, the interrupt
                                   level number is placed on lines A1, A2, and A3. Lines A0 and A4 through the most
                                   significant address line are driven to logic high.


                                  3.2    DATA BUS (D15–D0; MC68008: D7–D0)
                                  This bidirectional, three-state bus is the general-purpose data path. It is 16 bits wide in the
                                  all the processors except the MC68008 which is 8 bits wide. The bus can transfer and
                                  accept data of either word or byte length. During an interrupt acknowledge cycle, the
                                  external device supplies the vector number on data lines D7–D0. The MC68EC000 and
                                  MC68HC001 use D7–D0 in 8-bit mode, and D15–D8 are undefined.


                                  3.3    ASYNCHRONOUS BUS CONTROL
                                    Asynchronous data transfers are controlled by the following signals: address strobe,
                                    read/write, upper and lower data strobes, and data transfer acknowledge. These signals
                                    are described in the following paragraphs.

                                  Address Strobe ( AS).
                                   This three-state signal indicates that the information on the address bus is a valid
                                   address.

                                  Read/Write (R/ W).
                                    This three-state signal defines the data bus transfer as a read or write cycle. The R/W
                                    signal relates to the data strobe signals described in the following paragraphs.

                                  Upper And Lower Data Strobes ( UDS, LDS).
                                   These three-state signals and R/W control the flow of data on the data bus. Table 3-1
                                   lists the combinations of these signals and the corresponding data on the bus. When
                                   the R/W line is high, the processor reads from the data bus. When the R/W line is low,
                                   the processor drives the data bus. In 8-bit mode, UDS is always forced high and the
                                   LDS signal is used.

                                    This input signal indicates the completion of the data transfer. When the processor
                                    recognizes DTACK during a read cycle, data is latched, and the bus cycle is terminated.
                                    When DTACK is recognized during a write cycle, the bus cycle is terminated.

                                  3.4 BUS ARBITRATION CONTROL
                                  The bus request, bus grant, and bus grant acknowledge signals form a bus arbitration
                                  circuit to determine which device becomes the bus master device. In the 48-pin version of
                                  the MC68008 and MC68EC000, no pin is available for the bus grant acknowledge signal;
                                  this microprocessor uses a two-wire bus arbitration scheme. All M68000 processors can
                                  use two-wire bus arbitration.

                                  Bus Request ( BR).
                                   This input can be wire-ORed with bus request signals from all other devices that could
                                   be bus masters. This signal indicates to the processor that some other device needs to
                                   become the bus master. Bus requests can be issued at any time during a cycle or
                                   between cycles.

                                  Bus Grant (BG).
                                   This output signal indicates to all other potential bus master devices that the processor
                                   will relinquish bus control at the end of the current bus cycle.

                                  Bus Grant Acknowledge ( BGACK).
                                   This input indicates that some other device has become the bus master. This signal
                                   should not be asserted until the following conditions are met:
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                        1. A bus grant has been received.
                                        2. Address strobe is inactive, which indicates that the microprocessor is not using the
                                           bus.
                                        3. Data transfer acknowledge is inactive, which indicates that neither memory nor
                                           peripherals are using the bus.
                                        4. Bus grant acknowledge is inactive, which indicates that no other device is still
                                           claiming bus mastership.

                                    The 48-pin version of the MC68008 has no pin available for the bus grant acknowledge
                                    signal and uses a two-wire bus arbitration scheme instead. If another device in a system
                                    supplies a bus grant acknowledge signal, the bus request input signal to the processor
                                    should be asserted when either the bus request or the bus grant acknowledge from that
                                    device is asserted.

                                  3.5 INTERRUPT CONTROL (IPL0 , IPL1 , IPL2)
                                  These input signals indicate the encoded priority level of the device requesting an
                                  interrupt. Level seven, which cannot be masked, has the highest priority; level zero
                                  indicates that no interrupts are requested. IPL0 is the least significant bit of the encoded
                                  level, and IPL2 is the most significant bit. For each interrupt request, these signals must
                                  remain asserted until the processor signals interrupt acknowledge (FC2–FC0 and A19–
                                  A16 high) for that request to ensure that the interrupt is recognized.

                                                                              NOTE
                                                 The 48-pin version of the MC68008 has only two interrupt
                                                 control signals: IPL0/IPL2 and IPL1. IPL0/IPL2 is internally
                                                 connected to both IPL0 and IPL2, which provides four interrupt
                                                 priority levels: levels 0, 2, 5, and 7. In all other respects, the
                                                 interrupt priority levels in this version of the MC68008 are
                                                 identical to those levels in the other microprocessors described
                                                 in this manual.

                                  3.6 SYSTEM CONTROL
                                  The system control inputs are used to reset the processor, to halt the processor, and to
                                  signal a bus error to the processor. The outputs reset the external devices in the system
                                  and signal a processor error halt to those devices. The three system control signals are
                                  described in the following paragraphs.

                                  Bus Error ( BERR)
                                   This input signal indicates a problem in the current bus cycle. The problem may be the
                                   following:

                                      1.   No response from a device.
                                      2.   No interrupt vector number returned.
                                      3.   An illegal access request rejected by a memory management unit.
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                      4.   Some other application-dependent error.

                                    Either the processor retries the bus cycle or performs exception processing, as
                                    determined by interaction between the bus error signal and the halt signal.

                                  Reset ( RESET )
                                    The external assertion of this bidirectional signal along with the assertion of HALT starts
                                    a system initialization sequence by resetting the processor. The processor assertion of
                                    RESET (from executing a RESET instruction) resets all external devices of a system
                                    without affecting the internal state of the processor. To reset both the processor and the
                                    external devices, the RESET and HALT input signals must be asserted at the same
                                    time.

                                  Halt (HALT )
                                    An input to this bidirectional signal causes the processor to stop bus activity at the
                                    completion of the current bus cycle. This operation places all control signals in the
                                    inactive state and places all three-state lines in the high-impedance state (refer to Table
                                    3-4).

                                    When the processor has stopped executing instructions (in the case of a double bus
                                    fault condition, for example), the HALT line is driven by the processor to indicate the
                                    condition to external devices.

                                  Mode (MODE) (MC68HC001/68EC000)
                                   The MODE input selects between the 8-bit and 16-bit operating modes. If this input is
                                   grounded at reset, the processor will come out of reset in the 8-bit mode. If this input is
                                   tied high or floating at reset, the processor will come out of reset in the 16-bit mode.
                                   This input should be changed only at reset and must be stable two clocks after RESET
                                   is negated. Changing this input during normal operation may produce unpredictable
                                   results.

                                  3.7 M6800 PERIPHERAL CONTROL
                                  These control signals are used to interface the asynchronous M68000 processors with the
                                  synchronous M6800 peripheral devices. These signals are described in the following
                                  paragraphs.

                                  Enable (E)
                                    This signal is the standard enable signal common to all M6800 Family peripheral
                                    devices. A single period of clock E consists of 10 MC68000 clock periods (six clocks
                                    low, four clocks high). This signal is generated by an internal ring counter that may
                                    come up in any state. (At power-on, it is impossible to guarantee phase relationship of E
                                    to CLK.) The E signal is a free-running clock that runs regardless of the state of the
                                    MPU bus.

                                  Valid Peripheral Address (VPA )
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                    This input signal indicates that the device or memory area addressed is an M6800
                                    Family device or a memory area assigned to M6800 Family devices and that data
                                    transfer should be synchronized with the E signal. This input also indicates that the
                                    processor should use automatic vectoring for an interrupt. Refer to Appendix B M6800
                                    Peripheral Interface.

                                  Valid Memory Address ( VMA)
                                    This output signal indicates to M6800 peripheral devices that the address on the
                                    address bus is valid and that the processor is synchronized to the E signal. This signal
                                    only responds to a VPA input that identifies an M6800 Family device.

                                    The MC68008 does not supply a VMA signal. This signal can be produced by a
                                    transistor-to-transistor logic (TTL) circuit; an example is described in Appendix B
                                    M6800 Peripheral Interface.

                                  These function code outputs indicate the mode (user or supervisor) and the address
                                  space type currently being accessed, as shown in Table 3-3. The function code outputs

                                  3.9 CLOCK (CLK)
                                  The clock input is a TTL-compatible signal that is internally buffered for development of
                                  the internal clocks needed by the processor. This clock signal is a constant frequency
                                  square wave that requires no stretching or shaping. The clock input should not be gated
                                  off at any time, and the clock signal must conform to minimum and maximum pulse-width
                                  times listed in Section 10 Electrical Characteristics.

                                  SECTION 4
                                  8-BIT BUS OPERATION
                                  The following paragraphs describe control signal and bus operation for 8-bit operation
                                  during data transfer operations, bus arbitration, bus error and halt conditions, and reset
                                  operation. The 8-bit bus operations devices are the MC68008, MC68HC001 in 8-bit mode,
                                  and MC68EC000 in 8-bit mode. The MC68HC001 and MC68EC000 select 8-bit mode by
                                  grounding mode during reset.

                                  4.1 DATA TRANSFER OPERATIONS
                                  Transfer of data between devices involves the following signals:
                                    1. Address bus A0 through highest numbered address line
                                    2. Data bus D0 through D7
                                    3. Control signals

                                  The address and data buses are separate parallel buses used to transfer data using an
                                  asynchronous bus structure. In all cases, the bus master must deskew all signals it issues
                                  at both the start and end of a bus cycle. In addition, the bus master must deskew the
                                  acknowledge and data signals from the slave device. For the MC68HC001 and
                                  MC68EC000, UDS is held negated and D15–D8 are undefined in 8-bit mode.

                                  The following paragraphs describe the read, write, read-modify-write, and CPU space
                                  cycles. The indivisible read-modify-write cycle implements interlocked multiprocessor
                                  communications. A CPU space cycle is a special processor cycle.

                                  4.1.1 Read Cycle
                                  During a read cycle, the processor receives one byte of data from the memory or from a
                                  peripheral device. When the data is received, the processor internally positions the byte
                                  appropriately.

                                  The 8-bit operation must perform two or four read cycles to access a word or long word,
                                  asserting the data strobe to read a single byte during each cycle. The address bus in 8-bit
                                  operation includes A0, which selects the appropriate byte for each read cycle. Figure 4-1
                                  and 4-2 illustrate the byte read-cycle operation.

                                  A bus cycle consists of eight states. The various signals are asserted during specific
                                  states of a read cycle, as follows:

                                  STATE 0      The read cycle starts in state 0 (S0). The processor places valid function
                                               codes on FC0–FC2 and drives R/W high to identify a read cycle.

                                  STATE 1      Entering state 1 (S1), the processor drives a valid address on the address
                                               bus.

                                  STATE 2      On the rising edge of state 2 (S2), the processor asserts AS and LDS,
                                               or DS.

                                  STATE 3      During state 3 (S3), no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 4      During state 4 (S4), the processor waits for a cycle termination signal
                                               (DTACK or BERR) or VPA, an M6800 peripheral signal. When VPA is
                                               asserted during S4, the cycle becomes a peripheral cycle (refer to
                                               Appendix B M6800 Peripheral Interface). If neither termination signal is
                                               asserted before the falling edge at the end of S4, the processor inserts wait
                                               states (full clock cycles) until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 5      During state 5 (S5), no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 6      During state 6 (S6), data from the device is driven onto the data bus.

                                  STATE 7      On the falling edge of the clock entering state 7 (S7), the processor latches
                                               data from the addressed device and negates A S and L D S, or DS. At
                                               the rising edge of S7, the processor places the address bus in the high-
                                               impedance state. The device negates DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                                                            NOTE
                                               During an active bus cycle, VPA and BERR are sampled on
                                               every falling edge of the clock beginning with S4, and data is
                                               latched on the falling edge of S6 during a read cycle. The bus
                                               cycle terminates in S7, except when BERR is asserted in the
                                               absence of DTACK. In that case, the bus cycle terminates one
                                               clock cycle later in S9.

                                  4.1.2 Write Cycle
                                  During a write cycle, the processor sends bytes of data to the memory or peripheral
                                  device. Figures 4-3 and 4-4 illustrate the write-cycle operation

                                  The 8-bit operation performs two write cycles for a word write operation, issuing the data
                                  strobe signal during each cycle. The address bus includes the A0 bit to select the desired
                                  byte.

                                  The descriptions of the eight states of a write cycle are as follows:

                                  STATE 0       The write cycle starts in S0. The processor places valid function codes on
                                                FC2–FC0 and drives R/W high (if a preceding write cycle has left R/W low).

                                  STATE 1       Entering S1, the processor drives a valid address on the address bus.

                                  STATE 2       On the rising edge of S2, the processor asserts AS and drives R/W low.

                                  STATE 3       During S3, the data bus is driven out of the high-impedance state as the
                                                data to be written is placed on the bus.

                                  STATE 4       At the rising edge of S4, the processor asserts L D S, or D S. The
                                                processor waits for a cycle termination signal (DTACK or BERR) or VPA, an
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                                M6800 peripheral signal. When VPA is asserted during S4, the cycle
                                                becomes a peripheral cycle (refer to Appendix B M6800 Peripheral
                                                Interface). If neither termination signal is asserted before the falling
                                                edge at the end of S4, the processor inserts wait states (full clock cycles)
                                                until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 5       During S5, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 6       During S6, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 7       On the falling edge of the clock entering S7, the processor negates AS,
                                                LDS, and DS. As the clock rises at the end of S7, the processor places
                                                the address and data buses in the high-impedance state, and drives R/W
                                                high. The device negates DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                  4.1.3 Read-Modify-Write Cycle.
                                  The read-modify-write cycle performs a read operation, modifies the data in the arithmetic
                                  logic unit, and writes the data back to the same address. The address strobe ( AS) remains
                                  asserted throughout the entire cycle, making the cycle indivisible. The test and set (TAS)
                                  instruction uses this cycle to provide a signaling capability without deadlock between
                                  processors in a multiprocessing environment. The TAS instruction (the only instruction
                                  that uses the read-modify-write cycle) only operates on bytes. Thus, all read-modify-write
                                  cycles are byte operations. Figure 4-5 and 4-6 illustrate the read-modify-write cycle
                                  operation.

                                                      Figure 4-6. Read-Modify-Write Cycle Timing Diagram

                                  The descriptions of the read-modify-write cycle states are as follows:
                                  STATE 0        The read cycle starts in S0. The processor places valid function codes on
                                                 FC2–FC0 and drives R/W high to identify a read cycle.

                                  STATE 1        Entering S1, the processor drives a valid address on the address bus.

                                  STATE 2        On the rising edge of S2, the processor asserts AS and LDS, or DS.

                                  STATE 3        During S3, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 4        During S4, the processor waits for a cycle termination signal (DTACK or
                                                 BERR) or VPA, an M6800 peripheral signal. When VPA is asserted during
                                                 S4, the cycle becomes a peripheral cycle (refer to Appendix B M6800
                                                 Peripheral Interface). If neither termination signal is asserted before the
                                                 falling edge at the end of S4, the processor inserts wait states (full clock
                                                 cycles) until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 5        During S5, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 6        During S6, data from the device are driven onto the data bus.

                                  STATE 7        On the falling edge of the clock entering S7, the processor accepts data
                                                 from the device and negates L D S , and D S. The device negates
                                                 DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                  STATES 8–11
                                            The bus signals are unaltered during S8–S11, during which the arithmetic
                                            logic unit makes appropriate modifications to the data.

                                  STATE 12     The write portion of the cycle starts in S12. The valid function codes on
                                               FC2–FC0, the address bus lines, AS, and R/W remain unaltered.

                                  STATE 13     During S13, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 14     On the rising edge of S14, the processor drives R/W low.

                                  STATE 15     During S15, the data bus is driven out of the high-impedance state as the
                                               data to be written are placed on the bus.

                                  STATE 16 At the rising edge of S16, the processor asserts L D S or DS. The
                                           processor waits for DTACK or BERR or VPA, an M6800 peripheral signal.
                                           When VPA is asserted during S16, the cycle becomes a peripheral cycle
                                           (refer to Appendix B M6800 Peripheral Interface). If neither termination

                                           signal is asserted before the falling edge at the close of S16, the processor
                                           inserts wait states (full clock cycles) until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 17     During S17, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 18     During S18, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 19     On the falling edge of the clock entering S19, the processor negates AS,
                                               L D S , and DS. As the clock rises at the end of S19, the processor
                                               places the address and data buses in the high-impedance state, and drives
                                               R/W high. The device negates DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                  5.1 DATA TRANSFER OPERATIONS
                                  Transfer of data between devices involves the following signals:
                                    1. Address bus A1 through highest numbered address line
                                    2. Data bus D0 through D15
                                    3. Control signals

                                  The address and data buses are separate parallel buses used to transfer data using an
                                  asynchronous bus structure. In all cases, the bus master must deskew all signals it issues
                                  at both the start and end of a bus cycle. In addition, the bus master must deskew the
                                  acknowledge and data signals from the slave device.

                                  The following paragraphs describe the read, write, read-modify-write, and CPU space
                                  cycles. The indivisible read-modify-write cycle implements interlocked multiprocessor
                                  communications. A CPU space cycle is a special processor cycle.

                                  5.1.1 Read Cycle
                                  During a read cycle, the processor receives either one or two bytes of data from the
                                  memory or from a peripheral device. If the instruction specifies a word or long-word
                                  operation, the MC68000, MC68HC000, MC68HC001, MC68EC000, or MC68010
                                  processor reads both upper and lower bytes simultaneously by asserting both upper and
                                  lower data strobes. When the instruction specifies byte operation, the processor uses the
                                  internal A0 bit to determine which byte to read and issues the appropriate data strobe.
                                  When A0 equals zero, the upper data strobe is issued; when A0 equals one, the lower
                                  data strobe is issued. When the data is received, the processor internally positions the
                                  byte appropriately.

                                  The word read-cycle flowchart is shown in Figure 5-1 and the byte read-cycle flowchart is
                                  shown in Figure 5-2. The read and write cycle timing is shown in Figure 5-3 and the word
                                  and byte read-cycle timing diagram is shown in Figure 5-4.

                                  A bus cycle consists of eight states. The various signals are asserted during specific
                                  states of a read cycle, as follows:

                                  STATE 0      The read cycle starts in state 0 (S0). The processor places valid function
                                               codes on FC0–FC2 and drives R/W high to identify a read cycle.

                                  STATE 1      Entering state 1 (S1), the processor drives a valid address on the address
                                               bus.

                                  STATE 2      On the rising edge of state 2 (S2), the processor asserts AS and UDS, LDS,
                                               or DS.

                                  STATE 3      During state 3 (S3), no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 4      During state 4 (S4), the processor waits for a cycle termination signal
                                               (DTACK or BERR) or VPA, an M6800 peripheral signal. When VPA is
                                               asserted during S4, the cycle becomes a peripheral cycle (refer to
                                               Appendix B M6800 Peripheral Interface). If neither termination signal is
                                               asserted before the falling edge at the end of S4, the processor inserts wait
                                               states (full clock cycles) until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 5      During state 5 (S5), no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 6      During state 6 (S6), data from the device is driven onto the data bus.

                                  STATE 7      On the falling edge of the clock entering state 7 (S7), the processor latches
                                               data from the addressed device and negates AS, U D S, and LDS. At
                                               the rising edge of S7, the processor places the address bus in the high-
                                               impedance state. The device negates DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                                                            NOTE
                                               During an active bus cycle, VPA and BERR are sampled on
                                               every falling edge of the clock beginning with S4, and data is
                                               latched on the falling edge of S6 during a read cycle. The bus
                                               cycle terminates in S7, except when BERR is asserted in the
                                               absence of DTACK. In that case, the bus cycle terminates one
                                               clock cycle later in S9.

                                  5.1.2 Write Cycle
                                  During a write cycle, the processor sends bytes of data to the memory or peripheral
                                  device. If the instruction specifies a word operation, the processor issues both UDS and
                                  LDS and writes both bytes. When the instruction specifies a byte operation, the processor
                                  uses the internal A0 bit to determine which byte to write and issues the appropriate data
                                  strobe. When the A0 bit equals zero, UDS is asserted; when the A0 bit equals one, LDS is
                                  asserted.

                                  The descriptions of the eight states of a write cycle are as follows:
                                  STATE 0           The write cycle starts in S0. The processor places valid function codes on
                                                    FC2–FC0 and drives R/W high (if a preceding write cycle has left R/W low).

                                  STATE 1           Entering S1, the processor drives a valid address on the address bus.

                                  STATE 2           On the rising edge of S2, the processor asserts AS and drives R/W low.

                                  STATE 3           During S3, the data bus is driven out of the high-impedance state as the
                                                    data to be written is placed on the bus.

                                  STATE 4           At the rising edge of S4, the processor asserts U D S , or LDS. The
                                                    processor waits for a cycle termination signal (DTACK or BERR) or VPA, an
                                                    M6800 peripheral signal. When VPA is asserted during S4, the cycle
                                                    becomes a peripheral cycle (refer to Appendix B M6800 Peripheral
                                                    Interface. If neither termination signal is asserted before the falling
                                                    edge at the end of S4, the processor inserts wait states (full clock cycles)
                                                    until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 5           During S5, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 6           During S6, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 7           On the falling edge of the clock entering S7, the processor negates AS,
                                                    UDS, or LDS. As the clock rises at the end of S7, the processor places
                                                    the address and data buses in the high-impedance state, and drives R/W
                                                    high. The device negates DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                  5.1.3 Read-Modify-Write Cycle.
                                  The read-modify-write cycle performs a read operation, modifies the data in the arithmetic
                                  logic unit, and writes the data back to the same address. The address strobe ( AS) remains
                                  asserted throughout the entire cycle, making the cycle indivisible. The test and set (TAS)
                                  instruction uses this cycle to provide a signaling capability without deadlock between
                                  processors in a multiprocessing environment. The TAS instruction (the only instruction
                                  that uses the read-modify-write cycle) only operates on bytes. Thus, all read-modify-write
                                  cycles are byte operations. The read-modify-write flowchart shown in Figure 5-8 and the

                                                      Figure 5-9. Read-Modify-Write Cycle Timing Diagram

                                  The descriptions of the read-modify-write cycle states are as follows:
                                  STATE 0        The read cycle starts in S0. The processor places valid function codes on
                                                 FC2–FC0 and drives R/W high to identify a read cycle.

                                  STATE 1        Entering S1, the processor drives a valid address on the address bus.

                                  STATE 2        On the rising edge of S2, the processor asserts AS and UDS, or LDS.

                                  STATE 3        During S3, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 4        During S4, the processor waits for a cycle termination signal (DTACK or
                                                 BERR) or VPA, an M6800 peripheral signal. When VPA is asserted during
                                                 S4, the cycle becomes a peripheral cycle (refer to Appendix B M6800
                                                 Peripheral Interface). If neither termination signal is asserted before the
                                                 falling edge at the end of S4, the processor inserts wait states (full clock
                                                 cycles) until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 5        During S5, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 6        During S6, data from the device are driven onto the data bus.

                                  STATE 7        On the falling edge of the clock entering S7, the processor accepts data
                                                 from the device and negates U D S , and LDS. The device negates
                                                 DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                  STATES 8–11
                                            The bus signals are unaltered during S8–S11, during which the arithmetic
                                            logic unit makes appropriate modifications to the data.

                                  STATE 12         The write portion of the cycle starts in S12. The valid function codes on
                                                   FC2–FC0, the address bus lines, AS, and R/W remain unaltered.

                                  STATE 13         During S13, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 14         On the rising edge of S14, the processor drives R/W low.

                                  STATE 15         During S15, the data bus is driven out of the high-impedance state as the
                                                   data to be written are placed on the bus.

                                  STATE 16 At the rising edge of S16, the processor asserts U D S or L D S . The
                                           processor waits for DTACK or BERR or VPA, an M6800 peripheral signal.
                                           When VPA is asserted during S16, the cycle becomes a peripheral cycle
                                           (refer to Appendix B M6800 Peripheral Interface). If neither termination

                                           signal is asserted before the falling edge at the close of S16, the processor
                                           inserts wait states (full clock cycles) until either DTACK or BERR is asserted.

                                  STATE 17         During S17, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 18         During S18, no bus signals are altered.

                                  STATE 19         On the falling edge of the clock entering S19, the processor negates AS,
                                                   UDS, and LDS. As the clock rises at the end of S19, the processor
                                                   places the address and data buses in the high-impedance state, and drives
                                                   R/W high. The device negates DTACK or BERR at this time.

                                  5.1.4 CPU Space Cycle
                                  A CPU space cycle, indicated when the function codes are all high, is a special processor
                                  cycle. Bits A16–A19 of the address bus identify eight types of CPU space cycles. Only the
                                  interrupt acknowledge cycle, in which A16–A19 are high, applies to all the
                                  microprocessors described in this manual. The MC68010 defines an additional type of
                                  CPU space cycle, the breakpoint acknowledge cycle, in which A16–A19 are all low. Other
                                  configurations of A16–A19 are reserved by Motorola to define other types of CPU cycles
                                  used in other M68000 Family microprocessors. Figure 5-10 shows the encoding of CPU
                                  space addresses.

                                  The interrupt acknowledge cycle places the level of the interrupt being acknowledged on
                                  address bits A3–A1 and drives all other address lines high. The interrupt acknowledge
                                  cycle reads a vector number when the interrupting device places a vector number on the
                                  data bus and asserts DTACK to acknowledge the cycle.

                                  The timing diagram for an interrupt acknowledge cycle is shown in Figure 5-11.
                                  Alternately, the interrupt acknowledge cycle can be autovectored. The interrupt
                                  acknowledge cycle is the same, except the interrupting device asserts VPA instead of
                                  DTACK. For an autovectored interrupt, the vector number used is $18 plus the interrupt
                                  level. This is generated internally by the microprocessor when VPA (or AVEC) is asserted
                                  on an interrupt acknowledge cycle. DTACK and V P A (A V E C) should never be
                                  simultaneously asserted.

                                  The breakpoint acknowledge cycle is performed by the MC68010 to provide an indication
                                  to hardware that a software breakpoint is being executed when the processor executes a
                                  breakpoint (BKPT) instruction. The processor neither accepts nor sends data during this
                                  cycle, which is otherwise similar to a read cycle. The cycle is terminated by either DTACK,
                                  BERR, or as an M6800 peripheral cycle when V P A is asserted, and the processor
                                  continues illegal instruction exception processing. Figure 5-12 illustrates the timing

                                  5.2 BUS ARBITRATION
                                  Bus arbitration is a technique used by bus master devices to request, to be granted, and
                                  to acknowledge bus mastership. Bus arbitration consists of the following:
                                     1. Asserting a bus mastership request
                                     2. Receiving a grant indicating that the bus is available at the end of the current cycle
                                     3. Acknowledging that mastership has been assumed

                                  There are two ways to arbitrate the bus, 3-wire and 2-wire bus arbitration. The MC68000,
                                  MC68HC000, MC68EC000, MC68HC001, MC68008, and MC68010 can do 2-wire bus
                                  arbitration. The MC68000, MC68HC000, MC68HC001, and MC68010 can do 3-wire bus
                                  arbitration. Figures 5-13 and 5-15 show 3-wire bus arbitration and Figures 5-14 and 5-16
                                  show 2-wire bus arbitration. Bus arbitration on all microprocessors, except the 48-pin
                                  MC68008 and MC68EC000, BGACK must be pulled high for 2-wire bus arbitration.

                                                          Figure 5-16. 2-Wire Bus Arbitration Timing Diagram

                                  The timing diagram in Figure 5-15 shows that the bus request is negated at the time that
                                  an acknowledge is asserted. This type of operation applies to a system consisting of a
                                  processor and one other device capable of becoming bus master. In systems having
                                  several devices that can be bus masters, bus request lines from these devices can be
                                  wire-ORed at the processor, and more than one bus request signal could occur.

                                  The bus grant signal is negated a few clock cycles after the assertion of the bus grant
                                  acknowledge signal. However, if bus requests are pending, the processor reasserts bus
                                  grant for another request a few clock cycles after bus grant (for the previous request) is
                                  negated. In response to this additional assertion of bus grant, external arbitration circuitry
                                  selects the next bus master before the current bus master has completed the bus activity.

                                  The timing diagram in Figure 5-15 also applies to a system consisting of a processor and
                                  one other device capable of becoming bus master. Since the 48-pin version of the
                                  MC68008 and the MC68EC000 does not recognize a bus grant acknowledge signal, this
                                  processor does not negate bus grant until the current bus master has completed the bus
                                  activity.

                                  5.2.1 Requesting The Bus
                                  External devices capable of becoming bus masters assert BR to request the bus. This
                                  signal can be wire-ORed (not necessarily constructed from open-collector devices) from
                                  any of the devices in the system that can become bus master. The processor, which is at
                                  a lower bus priority level than the external devices, relinquishes the bus after it completes
                                  the current bus cycle.

                                  The bus grant acknowledge signal on all the processors except the 48-pin MC68008 and
                                  MC68EC000 helps to prevent the bus arbitration circuitry from responding to noise on the

                                                                            Go to: www.freescale.com

                                  bus request signal. When no acknowledge is received before the bus request signal is
                                  negated, the processor continues the use of the bus.

                                  5.2.2 Receiving The Bus Grant
                                  The processor asserts BG as soon as possible. Normally, this process immediately follows
                                  internal synchronization, except when the processor has made an internal decision to
                                  execute the next bus cycle but has not yet asserted AS for that cycle. In this case, BG is
                                  delayed until AS is asserted to indicate to external devices that a bus cycle is in progress.

                                  BG can be routed through a daisy-chained network or through a specific priority-encoded
                                  network. Any method of external arbitration that observes the protocol can be used.

Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                  Upon receiving BG, the requesting device waits until AS, DTACK, and BGACK are negated
                                  before asserting BGACK. The negation of AS indicates that the previous bus master has
                                  completed its cycle. (No device is allowed to assume bus mastership while AS is
                                  asserted.) The negation of BGACK indicates that the previous master has released the
                                  bus. The negation of DTACK indicates that the previous slave has terminated the
                                  connection to the previous master. (In some applications, DTACK might not be included in
                                  this function; general-purpose devices would be connected using AS only.) When BGACK
                                  is asserted, the asserting device is bus master until it negates BGACK. BGACK should not
                                  be negated until after the bus cycle(s) is complete. A device relinquishes control of the bus
                                  by negating BGACK.

                                  The bus request from the granted device should be negated after BGACK is asserted. If
                                  another bus request is pending, BG is reasserted within a few clocks, as described in 5.3
                                  Bus Arbitration Control. The processor does not perform any external bus cycles before
                                  reasserting BG.


                                  5.3 BUS ARBITRATION CONTROL
                                  All asynchronous bus arbitration signals to the processor are synchronized before being
                                  used internally. As shown in Figure 5-17, synchronization requires a maximum of one
                                  cycle of the system clock, assuming that the asynchronous input setup time (#47, defined
                                  in Section 10 Electrical Characteristic) has been met. The input asynchronous signal is
                                  sampled on the falling edge of the clock and is valid internally after the next falling edge.

                                               Figure 5-17. External Asynchronous Signal Synchronization

                                  Bus arbitration control is implemented with a finite-state machine. State diagram (a) in
                                  Figure 5-18 applies to all processors using 3-wire bus arbitration and state diagram (b)
                                  applies to processors using 2-wire bus arbitration, in which BGACK is permanently
                                  negated internally or externally. The same finite-state machine is used, but it is effectively
                                  a two-state machine because BGACK is always negated.

                                  In Figure 5-18, input signals R and A are the internally synchronized versions of BR and
                                  BGACK. The BG output is shown as G, and the internal three-state control signal is shown
                                  as T. If T is true, the address, data, and control buses are placed in the high-impedance
                                  state when AS is negated. All signals are shown in positive logic (active high), regardless
                                  of their true active voltage level. State changes (valid outputs) occur on the next rising
                                  edge of the clock after the internal signal is valid.

                                  A timing diagram of the bus arbitration sequence during a processor bus cycle is shown in
                                  Figure 5-19. The bus arbitration timing while the bus is inactive (e.g., the processor is
                                  performing internal operations for a multiply instruction) is shown in Figure 5-20.

                                  When a bus request is made after the MPU has begun a bus cycle and before AS has
                                  been asserted (S0), the special sequence shown in Figure 5-21 applies. Instead of being
                                  asserted on the next rising edge of clock, BG is delayed until the second rising edge
                                  following its internal assertion.

                                  5.4. BUS ERROR AND HALT OPERATION
                                  In a bus architecture that requires a handshake from an external device, such as the
                                  asynchronous bus used in the M68000 Family, the handshake may not always occur. A
                                  bus error input is provided to terminate a bus cycle in error when the expected signal is
                                  not asserted. Different systems and different devices within the same system require
                                  different maximum-response times. External circuitry can be provided to assert the bus
                                  error signal after the appropriate delay following the assertion of address strobe.

                                  In a virtual memory system, the bus error signal can be used to indicate either a page fault
                                  or a bus timeout. An external memory management unit asserts bus error when the page
                                  that contains the required data is not resident in memory. The processor suspends
                                  execution of the current instruction while the page is loaded into memory. The MC68010
                                  pushes enough information on the stack to be able to resume execution of the instruction
                                  following return from the bus error exception handler.

                                                                 For More Information On This Product,
                                                                          Go to: www.freescale.com

                                  The MC68010 also differs from the other microprocessors described in this manual
                                  regarding bus errors. The MC68010 can detect a late bus error signal asserted within one
                                  clock cycle after the assertion of data transfer acknowledge. When receiving a bus error
                                  signal, the processor can either initiate a bus error exception sequence or try running the
                                  cycle again.

                                  5.4.1 Bus Error Operation
                                  In all the microprocessors described in this manual, a bus error is recognized when
                                  DTACK and HALT are negated and BERR is asserted. In the MC68010, a late bus error is
                                  also recognized when HALT is negated, and DTACK and BERR are asserted within one
                                  clock cycle.

                                  When the bus error condition is recognized, the current bus cycle is terminated in S9 for a

                                  read cycle, a write cycle, or the read portion of a read-modify-write cycle. For the write
                                  portion of a read-modify-write cycle, the current bus cycle is terminated in S21. As long as
                                  BERR remains asserted, the data and address buses are in the high-impedance state.
                                  Figure 5-25 shows the timing for the normal bus error, and Figure 5-26 shows the timing
                                  for the MC68010 late bus error.

                                  After the aborted bus cycle is terminated and BERR is negated, the processor enters
                                  exception processing for the bus error exception. During the exception processing
                                  sequence, the following information is placed on the supervisor stack:
                                    1. Status register
                                    2. Program counter (two words, which may be up to five words past the instruction
                                        being executed)
                                    3. Error information

                                  The first two items are identical to the information stacked by any other exception. The
                                  error information differs for the MC68010. The MC68000, MC68HC000, MC68HC001,
                                  MC68EC000, and MC68008 stack bus error information to help determine and to correct
                                  the error. The MC68010 stacks the frame format and the vector offset followed by 22
                                  words of internal register information. The return from exception (RTE) instruction restores
                                  the internal register information so that the MC68010 can continue execution of the
                                  instruction after the error handler routine completes.

                                  After the processor has placed the required information on the stack, the bus error
                                  exception vector is read from vector table entry 2 (offset $08) and placed in the program
                                  counter. The processor resumes execution at the address in the vector, which is the first
                                  instruction in the bus error handler routine.

                                                   In the MC68010, if a read-modify-write operation terminates in
                                                   a bus error, the processor reruns the entire read-modify-write
                                                   operation when the RTE instruction at the end of the bus error
                                                   handler returns control to the instruction in error. The
                                                   processor reruns the entire operation whether the error
                                                   occurred during the read or write portion.

                                  5.4.2 Retrying The Bus Cycle
                                  The assertion of the bus error signal during a bus cycle in which HALT is also asserted by
                                  an external device initiates a retry operation. Figure 5-27 is a timing diagram of the retry
                                  operation. The delayed BERR signal in the MC68010 also initiates a retry operation when
                                  HALT is asserted by an external device. Figure 5-28 shows the timing of the delayed

                                  The processor terminates the bus cycle, then puts the address and data lines in the high-
                                  impedance state. The processor remains in this state until HALT is negated. Then the
                                  processor retries the preceding cycle using the same function codes, address, and data
                                  (for a write operation). BERR should be negated at least one clock cycle before HALT is
                                  negated.

                                                                               NOTE
                                                   To guarantee that the entire read-modify-write cycle runs
                                                   correctly and that the write portion of the operation is
                                                   performed without negating the address strobe, the processor
                                                   does not retry a read-modify-write cycle. When a bus error
                                                   occurs during a read-modify-write operation, a bus error
                                                   operation is performed whether or not HALT is asserted.

                                  5.4.3 Halt Operation ( HALT)
                                  HALT performs a halt/run/single-step operation similar to the halt operation of an
                                  MC68000. When HALT is asserted by an external device, the processor halts and remains
                                  halted as long as the signal remains asserted, as shown in Figure 5-29.

                                  While the processor is halted, the address bus and the data bus signals are placed in the
                                  high-impedance state. Bus arbitration is performed as usual. Should a bus error occur
                                  while HALT is asserted, the processor performs the retry operation previously described.

                                  The single-step mode is derived from correctly timed transitions of HALT. HALT is negated
                                  to allow the processor to begin a bus cycle, then asserted to enter the halt mode when the
                                  cycle completes. The single-step mode proceeds through a program one bus cycle at a
                                  time for debugging purposes. The halt operation and the hardware trace capability allow
                                  tracing of either bus cycles or instructions one at a time. These capabilities and a software
                                  debugging package provide total debugging flexibility.

                                  5.4.4 Double Bus Fault
                                  When a bus error exception occurs, the processor begins exception processing by
                                  stacking information on the supervisor stack. If another bus error occurs during exception
                                  processing (i.e., before execution of another instruction begins) the processor halts and
                                  asserts HALT. This is called a double bus fault. Only an external reset operation can
                                  restart a processor halted due to a double bus fault.

                                  A retry operation does not initiate exception processing; a bus error during a retry
                                  operation does not cause a double bus fault. The processor can continue to retry a bus
                                  cycle indefinitely if external hardware requests.

                                  A double bus fault occurs during a reset operation when a bus error occurs while the
                                  processor is reading the vector table (before the first instruction is executed). The reset
                                  operation is described in the following paragraph.


                                  5.5 RESET OPERATION
                                  RESET is asserted externally for the initial processor reset. Subsequently, the signal can
                                  be asserted either externally or internally (executing a RESET instruction). For proper
                                  external reset operation, HALT must also be asserted.

                                  When RESET and HALT are driven by an external device, the entire system, including the
                                  processor, is reset. Resetting the processor initializes the internal state. The processor
                                  reads the reset vector table entry (address $00000) and loads the contents into the
                                  supervisor stack pointer (SSP). Next, the processor loads the contents of address $00004

                                  (vector table entry 1) into the program counter. Then the processor initializes the interrupt
                                  level in the status register to a value of seven. In the MC68010, the processor also clears
                                  the vector base register to $00000. No other register is affected by the reset sequence.
                                  Figure 5-30 shows the timing of the reset operation.

                                  The RESET instruction causes the processor to assert RESET for 124 clock periods to
                                  reset the external devices of the system. The internal state of the processor is not
                                  affected. Neither the status register nor any of the internal registers is affected by an
                                  internal reset operation. All external devices in the system should be reset at the
                                  completion of the RESET instruction.

                                  For the initial reset, RESET and HALT must be asserted for at least 100 ms. For a
                                  subsequent external reset, asserting these signals for 10 clock cycles or longer resets the

                                  executing a reset instruction is ignored. Since the processor asserts the RESET signal for
                                  124 clock cycles during execution of a reset instruction, an external reset should assert
                                  RESET for at least 132 clock periods.


                                  5.6 THE RELATIONSHIP OF            DTACK , BERR, AND HALT
                                  To properly control termination of a bus cycle for a retry or a bus error condition, DTACK,
                                  BERR, and HALT should be asserted and negated on the rising edge of the processor
                                  clock. This relationship assures that when two signals are asserted simultaneously, the
                                  required setup time (specification #47, Section 9 Electrical Characteristics) for both of
                                  them is met during the same bus state. External circuitry should be designed to
                                  incorporate this precaution. A related specification, #48, can be ignored when DTACK,
                                  BERR, and HALT are asserted and negated on the rising edge of the processor clock.

                                  The possible bus cycle termination can be summarized as follows (case numbers refer to
                                  Table 5-5).

                                  Normal Termination:        DTACK is asserted. BERR and HALT remain negated (case 1).

                                  Halt Termination:          HALT is asserted coincident with or preceding DTACK, and
                                                             BERR remains negated (case 2).

                                  Bus Error Termination:     BERR is asserted in lieu of, coincident with, or preceding
                                                             DTACK (case 3). In the MC68010, the late bus error also,
                                                             BERR is asserted following DTACK (case 4). HALT remains
                                                             negated and BERR is negated coincident with or after DTACK.

                                  Retry Termination:         HALT and BERR asserted in lieu of, coincident with, or before
                                                             DTACK (case 5). In the MC68010, the late retry also, BERR
                                                             and HALT are asserted following DTACK (case 6). BERR is
                                                             negated coincident with or after DTACK. HALT must be held at
                                                             least one cycle after BERR.

                                  The negation of BERR and HALT under several conditions is shown in Table 5-6. (DTACK
                                  is assumed to be negated normally in all cases; for reliable operation, both DTACK and
                                  BERR should be negated when address strobe is negated).

                                  EXAMPLE A:
                                    A system uses a watchdog timer to terminate accesses to unused address space. The
                                    timer asserts BERR after timeout (case 3).

                                  EXAMPLE B:
                                    A system uses error detection on random-access memory (RAM) contents. The system
                                    designer may:
                                      1. Delay DTACK until the data is verified. If data is invalid, return BERR and HALT
                                         simultaneously to retry the error cycle (case 5).
                                          2. Delay DTACK until the data is verified. If data is invalid, return BERR at the same
                                             time as DTACK (case 3).
                                          3. For an MC68010, return DTACK before data verification. If data is invalid, assert
                                             BERR and HALT to retry the error cycle (case 6).

                                  5.7 ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATION
                                  To achieve clock frequency independence at a system level, the bus can be operated in
                                  an asynchronous manner. Asynchronous bus operation uses the bus handshake signals
                                  to control the transfer of data. The handshake signals are AS, UDS, LDS, DS (MC68008
                                  only), DTACK, BERR, HALT, AVEC (MC68EC000 only), and VPA (only for M6800
                                  peripheral cycles). AS indicates the start of the bus cycle, and UDS, LDS, and DS signal
                                  valid data for a write cycle. After placing the requested data on the data bus (read cycle)
                                  or latching the data (write cycle), the slave device (memory or peripheral) asserts DTACK
                                  to terminate the bus cycle. If no device responds or if the access is invalid, external control
                                  logic asserts BERR, or BERR and HALT, to abort or retry the cycle. Figure 5-31 shows the
                                  use of the bus handshake signals in a fully asynchronous read cycle. Figure 5-32 shows a
                                  fully asynchronous write cycle.

                                  In the asynchronous mode, the accessed device operates independently of the frequency
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                  and phase of the system clock. For example, the MC68681 dual universal asynchronous
                                  receiver/transmitter (DUART) does not require any clock-related information from the bus
                                  master during a bus transfer. Asynchronous devices are designed to operate correctly
                                  with processors at any clock frequency when relevant timing requirements are observed.

                                  A device can use a clock at the same frequency as the system clock (e.g., 8, 10, or 12.5,
                                  16, and 20MHz), but without a defined phase relationship to the system clock. This mode
                                  of operation is pseudo-asynchronous; it increases performance by observing timing
                                  parameters related to the system clock frequency without being completely synchronous
                                  with that clock. A memory array designed to operate with a particular frequency processor
                                  but not driven by the processor clock is a common example of a pseudo-asynchronous
                                  device.

                                  The designer of a fully asynchronous system can make no assumptions about address
                                  setup time, which could be used to improve performance. With the system clock frequency
                                  known, the slave device can be designed to decode the address bus before recognizing
                                  an address strobe. Parameter #11 (refer to Section 10 Electrical Characteristics)
                                  specifies the minimum time before address strobe during which the address is valid.

                                  In a pseudo-asynchronous system, timing specifications allow DTACK to be asserted for a
                                  read cycle before the data from a slave device is valid. The length of time that DTACK
                                  may precede data is specified as parameter #31. This parameter must be met to ensure
                                  the validity of the data latched into the processor. No maximum time is specified from the
                                  assertion of AS to the assertion of DTACK. During this unlimited time, the processor
                                  inserts wait cycles in one-clock-period increments until DTACK is recognized. Figure 5-33
                                  shows the important timing parameters for a pseudo-asynchronous read cycle.

                                  During a write cycle, after the processor asserts AS but before driving the data bus, the
                                  processor drives R/W low. Parameter #55 specifies the minimum time between the
                                  transition of R/W and the driving of the data bus, which is effectively the maximum turnoff
                                  time for any device driving the data bus.

                                  After the processor places valid data on the bus, it asserts the data strobe signal(s). A
                                  data setup time, similar to the address setup time previously discussed, can be used to
                                  improve performance. Parameter #29 is the minimum time a slave device can accept valid
                                  data before recognizing a data strobe. The slave device asserts DTACK after it accepts
                                  the data. Parameter #25 is the minimum time after negation of the strobes during which
                                  the valid data remains on the address bus. Parameter #28 is the maximum time between
                                  the negation of the strobes by the processor and the negation of DTACK by the slave
                                  device. If DTACK remains asserted past the time specified by parameter #28, the
                                  processor may recognize it as being asserted early in the next bus cycle and may
                                  terminate that cycle prematurely. Figure 5-34 shows the important timing specifications for
                                  a pseudo-asynchronous write cycle.

                                        DTACK



                                                      Figure 5-34. Pseudo-Asynchronous Write Cycle

                                  In the MC68010, the BERR signal can be delayed after the assertion of DTACK.
                                  Specification #48 is the maximum time between assertion of DTACK and assertion of
                                  BERR. If this maximum delay is exceeded, operation of the processor may be erratic.


                                  5.8 SYNCHRONOUS OPERATION
                                  In some systems, external devices use the system clock to generate DTACK and other
                                  asynchronous input signals. This synchronous operation provides a closely coupled
                                  design with maximum performance, appropriate for frequently accessed parts of the
                                  system. For example, memory can operate in the synchronous mode, but peripheral
                                  devices operate asynchronously. For a synchronous device, the designer uses explicit
                                  timing information shown in Section 10 Electrical Characteristics. These specifications
                                  define the state of all bus signals relative to a specific state of the processor clock.

                                  The standard M68000 bus cycle consists of four clock periods (eight bus cycle states)
                                  and, optionally, an integral number of clock cycles inserted as wait states. Wait states are
                                  inserted as required to allow sufficient response time for the external device. The following
                                  state-by-state description of the bus cycle differs from those descriptions in 5.1.1 READ
                                  CYCLE and 5.1.2 WRITE CYCLE by including information about the important timing
                                  parameters that apply in the bus cycle states.

                                  STATE 0       The bus cycle starts in S0, during which the clock is high. At the rising edge
                                                of S0, the function code for the access is driven externally. Parameter #6A
                                                defines the delay from this rising edge until the function codes are valid.
                                                Also, the R/W signal is driven high; parameter #18 defines the delay from
                                                the same rising edge to the transition of R/W . The minimum value for
                                                parameter #18 applies to a read cycle preceded by a write cycle; this value

                                            is the maximum hold time for a low on R/W beyond the initiation of the read
                                            cycle.

                                  STATE 1   Entering S1, a low period of the clock, the address of the accessed device
                                            is driven externally with an assertion delay defined by parameter #6.

                                  STATE 2   On the rising edge of S2, a high period of the clock, AS is asserted. During
                                            a read cycle, UDS, LDS, and/or DS is also asserted at this time. Parameter
                                            #9 defines the assertion delay for these signals. For a write cycle, the R/W
                                            signal is driven low with a delay defined by parameter #20.

                                  STATE 3   On the falling edge of the clock entering S3, the data bus is driven out of
                                            the high-impedance state with the data being written to the accessed
                                            device (in a write cycle). Parameter #23 specifies the data assertion delay.

                                            In a read cycle, no signal is altered in S3.

                                  STATE 4   Entering the high clock period of S4, UDS, LDS, and/or DS is asserted
                                            (during a write cycle) on the rising edge of the clock. As in S2 for a read
                                            cycle, parameter #9 defines the assertion delay from the rising edge of S4
                                            for UDS, LDS, and/or DS. In a read cycle, no signal is altered by the
                                            processor during S4.

                                            Until the falling edge of the clock at the end of S4 (beginning of S5), no
                                            response from any external device except RESET is acknowledged by the
                                            processor. If either DTACK or BERR is asserted before the falling edge of
                                            S4 and satisfies the input setup time defined by parameter #47, the
                                            processor enters S5 and the bus cycle continues. If either DTACK or BERR
                                            is asserted but without meeting the setup time defined by parameter #47,
                                            the processor may recognize the signal and continue the bus cycle; the
                                            result is unpredictable. If neither DTACK nor BERR is asserted before the
                                            next rise of clock, the bus cycle remains in S4, and wait states (complete
                                            clock cycles) are inserted until one of the bus cycle termination is met.

                                  STATE 5   S5 is a low period of the clock, during which the processor does not alter
                                            any signal.

                                  STATE 6   S6 is a high period of the clock, during which data for a read operation is
                                            set up relative to the falling edge (entering S7). Parameter #27 defines the
                                            minimum period by which the data must precede the falling edge. For a
                                            write operation, the processor changes no signal during S6.

                                  STATE 7   On the falling edge of the clock entering S7, the processor latches data
                                            and negates AS and UDS, LDS, and/or DS during a read cycle. The hold
                                            time for these strobes from this falling edge is specified by parameter #12.
                                            The hold time for data relative to the negation of AS and UDS, LDS, and/or
                                            DS is specified by parameter #29. For a write cycle, only AS and UDS, LDS,
                                            and/or DS are negated; timing parameter #12 also applies.

                                                On the rising edge of the clock, at the end of S7 (which may be the start of
                                                S0 for the next bus cycle), the processor places the address bus in the
                                                high-impedance state. During a write cycle, the processor also places the
                                                data bus in the high-impedance state and drives R/W high. External logic
                                                circuitry should respond to the negation of the AS and UDS, LDS, and/or DS
                                                by negating DTACK and/or BERR. Parameter #28 is the hold time for
                                                DTACK, and parameter #30 is the hold time for BERR.

                                  A key consideration when designing in a synchronous environment is the timing for the
                                  assertion of DTACK and BERR by an external device. To properly use external inputs, the
                                  processor must synchronize these signals to the internal clock. The processor must
                                  sample the external signal, which has no defined phase relationship to the CPU clock,
                                  which may be changing at sampling time, and must determine whether to consider the
                                  signal high or low during the succeeding clock period. Successful synchronization requires
                                  that the internal machine receives a valid logic level (not a metastable signal), whether the
                                  input is high, low, or in transition. Metastable signals propagating through synchronous
                                  machines can produce unpredictable operation.

                                  Figure 5-37 is a conceptual representation of the input synchronizers used by the M68000
                                  Family processors. The input latches allow the input to propagate through to the output
                                  when E is high. When low, E latches the input. The three latches require one cycle of CLK
                                  to synchronize an external signal. The high-gain characteristics of the devices comprising
                                  the latches quickly resolve a marginal signal into a valid state.

                                  Parameter #47 of Section 10 Electrical Characteristics is the asynchronous input setup
                                  time. Signals that meet parameter #47 are guaranteed to be recognized at the next falling
                                  edge of the system clock. However, signals that do not meet parameter #47 are not
                                  guaranteed to be recognized. In addition, if DTACK is recognized on a falling edge, valid
                                  data is latched into the processor (during a read cycle) on the next falling edge, provided
                                  the data meets the setup time required (parameter #27). When parameter #27 has been
                                  met, parameter #31 may be ignored. If DTACK is asserted with the required setup time
                                  before the falling edge of S4, no wait states are incurred, and the bus cycle runs at its
                                  maximum speed of four clock periods.

                                  The late BERR in an MC68010 that is operating in a synchronous mode must meet setup
                                  time parameter #27A. That is, when BERR is asserted after DTACK, BERR must be
                                  asserted before the falling edge of the clock, one clock cycle after DTACK is recognized.
                                  Violating this requirement may cause the MC68010 to operate erratically.

                                  EXCEPTION PROCESSING
                                  This section describes operations of the processor outside the normal processing
                                  associated with the execution of instructions. The functions of the bits in the supervisor
                                  portion of the status register are described: the supervisor/user bit, the trace enable bit,
                                  and the interrupt priority mask. Finally, the sequence of memory references and actions
                                  taken by the processor for exception conditions are described in detail.

                                  The processor is always in one of three processing states: normal, exception, or halted.
                                  The normal processing state is associated with instruction execution; the memory
                                  references are to fetch instructions and operands and to store results. A special case of
                                  the normal state is the stopped state, resulting from execution of a STOP instruction. In
                                  this state, no further memory references are made.

                                  An additional, special case of the normal state is the loop mode of the MC68010,
                                  optionally entered when a test condition, decrement, and branch (DBcc) instruction is
                                  executed. In the loop mode, only operand fetches occur. See Appendix A MC68010
                                  Loop Mode Operation.

                                  The exception processing state is associated with interrupts, trap instructions, tracing, and
                                  other exceptional conditions. The exception may be internally generated by an instruction
                                  or by an unusual condition arising during the execution of an instruction. Externally,
                                  exception processing can be forced by an interrupt, by a bus error, or by a reset.
                                  Exception processing provides an efficient context switch so that the processor can
                                  handle unusual conditions.

                                  The halted processing state is an indication of catastrophic hardware failure. For example,
                                  if during the exception processing of a bus error another bus error occurs, the processor
                                  assumes the system is unusable and halts. Only an external reset can restart a halted
                                  processor. Note that a processor in the stopped state is not in the halted state, nor vice
                                  versa.


                                  6.1 PRIVILEGE MODES
                                  The processor operates in one of two levels of privilege: the supervisor mode or the user
                                  mode. The privilege mode determines which operations are legal. The mode is optionally
                                  used by an external memory management device to control and translate accesses. The
                                  mode is also used to choose between the supervisor stack pointer (SSP) and the user
                                  stack pointer (USP) in instruction references.

                                                                   Go to: www.freescale.com

                                  The privilege mode is a mechanism for providing security in a computer system. Programs
                                  should access only their own code and data areas and should be restricted from
                                  accessing information that they do not need and must not modify. The operating system
                                  executes in the supervisor mode, allowing it to access all resources required to perform
                                  the overhead tasks for the user mode programs. Most programs execute in user mode, in
                                  which the accesses are controlled and the effects on other parts of the system are limited.

                                  6.1.1 Supervisor Mode
                                  The supervisor mode has the higher level of privilege. The mode of the processor is
                                  determined by the S bit of the status register; if the S bit is set, the processor is in the
                                  supervisor mode. All instructions can be executed in the supervisor mode. The bus cycles
                                  generated by instructions executed in the supervisor mode are classified as supervisor
                                  references. While the processor is in the supervisor mode, those instructions that use

                                  either the system stack pointer implicitly or address register seven explicitly access the
                                  SSP.

                                  6.1.2 User Mode
                                  The user mode has the lower level of privilege. If the S bit of the status register is clear,
                                  the processor is executing instructions in the user mode.

                                  Most instructions execute identically in either mode. However, some instructions having
                                  important system effects are designated privileged. For example, user programs are not
                                  permitted to execute the STOP instruction or the RESET instruction. To ensure that a user
                                  program cannot enter the supervisor mode except in a controlled manner, the instructions
                                  that modify the entire status register are privileged. To aid in debugging systems software,
                                  the move to user stack pointer (MOVE to USP) and move from user stack pointer (MOVE
                                  from USP) instructions are privileged.

                                                                              NOTE
                                                To implement virtual machine concepts in the MC68010, the
                                                move from status register (MOVE from SR), move to/from
                                                control register (MOVEC), and move alternate address space
                                                (MOVES) instructions are also privileged.

                                  The bus cycles generated by an instruction executed in user mode are classified as user
                                  references. Classifying a bus cycle as a user reference allows an external memory
                                  management device to translate the addresses of and control access to protected portions
                                  of the address space. While the processor is in the user mode, those instructions that use
                                  either the system stack pointer implicitly or address register seven explicitly access the
                                  USP.

                                  6.1.3 Privilege Mode Changes
                                  Once the processor is in the user mode and executing instructions, only exception
                                  processing can change the privilege mode. During exception processing, the current state
                                  of the S bit of the status register is saved, and the S bit is set, putting the processor in the

                                  supervisor mode. Therefore, when instruction execution resumes at the address specified
                                  to process the exception, the processor is in the supervisor privilege mode.

                                                                                      NOTE
                                               The transition from supervisor to user mode can be
                                               accomplished by any of four instructions: return from exception
                                               (RTE) (MC68010 only), move to status register (MOVE to SR),
                                               AND immediate to status register (ANDI to SR), and exclusive
                                               OR immediate to status register (EORI to SR). The RTE
                                               instruction in the MC68010 fetches the new status register and
                                               program counter from the supervisor stack and loads each into
                                               its respective register. Next, it begins the instruction fetch at
                                               the new program counter address in the privilege mode

                                  The MOVE to SR, ANDI to SR, and EORI to SR instructions fetch all operands in the
                                  supervisor mode, perform the appropriate update to the status register, and then fetch the
                                  next instruction at the next sequential program counter address in the privilege mode
                                  determined by the new S bit.

                                  6.1.4 Reference Classification
                                  When the processor makes a reference, it classifies the reference according to the
                                  encoding of the three function code output lines. This classification allows external
                                  translation of addresses, control of access, and differentiation of special processor states,
                                  such as CPU space (used by interrupt acknowledge cycles). Table 6-1 lists the
                                  classification of references.

                                  6.2 EXCEPTION PROCESSING
                                  The processing of an exception occurs in four steps, with variations for different exception
                                  causes:
                                    1. Make a temporary copy of the status register and set the status register for
                                       exception processing.
                                    2. Obtain the exception vector.
                                    3. Save the current processor context.
                                    4. Obtain a new context and resume instruction processing.

                                  6.2.1 Exception Vectors
                                  An exception vector is a memory location from which the processor fetches the address of
                                  a routine to handle an exception. Each exception type requires a handler routine and a
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                  unique vector. All exception vectors are two words in length (see Figure 6-1), except for
                                  the reset vector, which is four words long. All exception vectors reside in the supervisor
                                  data space, except for the reset vector, which is in the supervisor program space. A vector
                                  number is an 8-bit number that is multiplied by four to obtain the offset of an exception
                                  vector. Vector numbers are generated internally or externally, depending on the cause of
                                  the exception. For interrupts, during the interrupt acknowledge bus cycle, a peripheral
                                  provides an 8-bit vector number (see Figure 6-2) to the processor on data bus lines D7–
                                  D0.

                                  The processor forms the vector offset by left-shifting the vector number two bit positions
                                  and zero-filling the upper-order bits to obtain a 32-bit long-word vector offset. In the
                                  MC68000, the MC68HC000, MC68HC001, MC68EC000, and the MC68008, this offset is
                                  used as the absolute address to obtain the exception vector itself, which is shown in
                                  Figure 6-3.

                                                                                NOTE
                                               In the MC68010, the vector offset is added to the 32-bit vector
                                               base register (VBR) to obtain the 32-bit absolute address of
                                               the exception vector (see Figure 6-4). Since the VBR is set to
                                               zero upon reset, the MC68010 functions identically to the
                                               MC68000, MC68HC000, MC68HC001, MC68EC000, and
                                               MC68008 until the VBR is changed via the move control
                                               register MOVEC instruction.

                                  The actual address on the address bus is truncated to the number of address bits
                                  available on the bus of the particular implementation of the M68000 architecture. In all
                                  processors except the MC68008, this is 24 address bits. (A0 is implicitly encoded in the
                                  data strobes.) In the MC68008, the address is 20 or 22 bits in length. The memory map for
                                  exception vectors is shown in Table 6-2.

                                  The vector table, Table 6-2, is 512 words long (1024 bytes), starting at address 0
                                  (decimal) and proceeding through address 1023 (decimal). The vector table provides 255
                                  unique vectors, some of which are reserved for trap and other system function vectors. Of
                                  the 255, 192 are reserved for user interrupt vectors. However, the first 64 entries are not
                                  protected, so user interrupt vectors may overlap at the discretion of the systems designer.

                                  Exceptions can be generated by either internal or external causes. The externally
                                  generated exceptions are the interrupts, the bus error, and reset. The interrupts are

                                  requests from peripheral devices for processor action; the bus error and reset inputs are
                                  used for access control and processor restart. The internal exceptions are generated by
                                  instructions, address errors, or tracing. The trap (TRAP), trap on overflow (TRAPV), check
                                  register against bounds (CHK), and divide (DIV) instructions can generate exceptions as
                                  part of their instruction execution. In addition, illegal instructions, word fetches from odd
                                  addresses, and privilege violations cause exceptions. Tracing is similar to a very high
                                  priority, internally generated interrupt following each instruction.

                                  6.2.3 Multiple Exceptions
                                  These paragraphs describe the processing that occurs when multiple exceptions arise
                                  simultaneously. Exceptions can be grouped by their occurrence and priority. The group 0
                                  exceptions are reset, bus error, and address error. These exceptions cause the instruction
                                  currently being executed to abort and the exception processing to commence within two
                                  clock cycles. The group 1 exceptions are trace and interrupt, privilege violations, and
                                  illegal instructions. Trace and interrupt exceptions allow the current instruction to execute
                                  to completion, but pre-empt the execution of the next instruction by forcing exception
                                  processing to occur. A privilege-violating instruction or an illegal instruction is detected
                                  when it is the next instruction to be executed. The group 2 exceptions occur as part of the
                                  normal processing of instructions. The TRAP, TRAPV, CHK, and zero divide exceptions
                                  are in this group. For these exceptions, the normal execution of an instruction may lead to
                                  exception processing.

                                  Group 0 exceptions have highest priority, whereas group 2 exceptions have lowest
                                  priority. Within group 0, reset has highest priority, followed by address error and then bus
                                  error. Within group 1, trace has priority over external interrupts, which in turn takes priority
                                  over illegal instruction and privilege violation. Since only one instruction can be executed
                                  at a time, no priority relationship applies within group 2.

                                  The priority relationship between two exceptions determines which is taken, or taken first,
                                  if the conditions for both arise simultaneously. Therefore, if a bus error occurs during a
                                  TRAP instruction, the bus error takes precedence, and the TRAP instruction processing is
                                  aborted. In another example, if an interrupt request occurs during the execution of an
                                  instruction while the T bit is asserted, the trace exception has priority and is processed
                                  first. Before instruction execution resumes, however, the interrupt exception is also
                                  processed, and instruction processing finally commences in the interrupt handler routine.
                                  A summary of exception grouping and priority is given in Table 6-3.

                                  As a general rule, the lower the priority of an exception, the sooner the handler routine for
                                  that exception executes. For example, if simultaneous trap, trace, and interrupt exceptions
                                  are pending, the exception processing for the trap occurs first, followed immediately by
                                  exception processing for the trace and then for the interrupt. When the processor resumes
                                  normal instruction execution, it is in the interrupt handler, which returns to the trace
                                  handler, which returns to the trap execution handler. This rule does not apply to the reset
                                  exception; its handler is executed first even though it has the highest priority, because the
                                  reset operation clears all other exceptions.

                                  6.2.4 Exception Stack Frames
                                  Exception processing saves the most volatile portion of the current processor context on
                                  the top of the supervisor stack. This context is organized in a format called the exception
                                  stack frame. Although this information varies with the particular processor and type of
                                  exception, it always includes the status register and program counter of the processor
                                  when the exception occurred.

                                  The amount and type of information saved on the stack are determined by the processor
                                  type and exception type. Exceptions are grouped by type according to priority of the
                                  exception.

                                  Of the group 0 exceptions, the reset exception does not stack any information. The
                                  information stacked by a bus error or address error exception in the MC68000,
                                  MC68HC000, MC68HC001, MC68EC000, or MC68008 is described in 6.3.9.1 Bus Error
                                  and shown in Figure 6-7.

                                  The MC68000, MC68HC000, MC68HC001, MC68EC000, and MC68008 group 1 and 2
                                  exception stack frame is shown in Figure 6-5. Only the program counter and status
                                  register are saved. The program counter points to the next instruction to be executed after
                                  exception processing.

                                  The MC68010 exception stack frame is shown in Figure 5-6. The number of words
                                  actually stacked depends on the exception type. Group 0 exceptions (except reset) stack
                                  29 words and group 1 and 2 exceptions stack four words. To support generic exception
                                  handlers, the processor also places the vector offset in the exception stack frame. The
                                  format code field allows the return from exception (RTE) instruction to identify what
                                  information is on the stack so that it can be properly restored. Table 6-4 lists the MC68010
                                  format codes. Although some formats are specific to a particular M68000 Family

                                  6.2.5 Exception Processing Sequence
                                  In the first step of exception processing, an internal copy is made of the status register.
                                  After the copy is made, the S bit of the status register is set, putting the processor into the
                                  supervisor mode. Also, the T bit is cleared, which allows the exception handler to execute
                                  unhindered by tracing. For the reset and interrupt exceptions, the interrupt priority mask is
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                  also updated appropriately.

                                  In the second step, the vector number of the exception is determined. For interrupts, the
                                  vector number is obtained by a processor bus cycle classified as an interrupt acknowledge
                                  cycle. For all other exceptions, internal logic provides the vector number. This vector
                                  number is then used to calculate the address of the exception vector.

                                  The third step, except for the reset exception, is to save the current processor status. (The
                                  reset exception does not save the context and skips this step.) The current program
                                  counter value and the saved copy of the status register are stacked using the SSP. The
                                  stacked program counter value usually points to the next unexecuted instruction.
                                  However, for bus error and address error, the value stacked for the program counter is
                                  unpredictable and may be incremented from the address of the instruction that caused the
                                  error. Group 1 and 2 exceptions use a short format exception stack frame (format = 0000
                                  on the MC68010). Additional information defining the current context is stacked for the bus
                                  error and address error exceptions.

                                  The last step is the same for all exceptions. The new program counter value is fetched
                                  from the exception vector. The processor then resumes instruction execution. The
                                  instruction at the address in the exception vector is fetched, and normal instruction
                                  decoding and execution is started.


                                  6.3 PROCESSING OF SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS
                                  The exceptions are classified according to their sources, and each type is processed
                                  differently. The following paragraphs describe in detail the types of exceptions and the
                                  processing of each type.

                                  6.3.1 Reset
                                  The reset exception corresponds to the highest exception level. The processing of the
                                  reset exception is performed for system initiation and recovery from catastrophic failure.
                                  Any processing in progress at the time of the reset is aborted and cannot be recovered.
                                  The processor is forced into the supervisor state, and the trace state is forced off. The

                                                                    Go to: www.freescale.com

                                  interrupt priority mask is set at level 7. In the MC68010, the VBR is forced to zero. The
                                  vector number is internally generated to reference the reset exception vector at location 0
                                  in the supervisor program space. Because no assumptions can be made about the validity
                                  of register contents, in particular the SSP, neither the program counter nor the status
                                  register is saved. The address in the first two words of the reset exception vector is
                                  fetched as the initial SSP, and the address in the last two words of the reset exception
                                  vector is fetched as the initial program counter. Finally, instruction execution is started at
                                  the address in the program counter. The initial program counter should point to the power-
                                  up/restart code.

                                  The RESET instruction does not cause a reset exception; it asserts the RESET signal to
                                  reset external devices, which allows the software to reset the system to a known state and
                                  continue processing with the next instruction.

                                  6.3.2 Interrupts
                                  Seven levels of interrupt priorities are provided, numbered from 1–7. All seven levels are
                                  available except for the 48-pin version for the MC68008.

                                                                               NOTE
                                                The MC68008 48-pin version supports only three interrupt
                                                levels: 2, 5, and 7. Level 7 has the highest priority.

                                  Devices can be chained externally within interrupt priority levels, allowing an unlimited
                                  number of peripheral devices to interrupt the processor. The status register contains a 3-
                                  bit mask indicating the current interrupt priority, and interrupts are inhibited for all priority
                                  levels less than or equal to the current priority.

                                  An interrupt request is made to the processor by encoding the interrupt request levels 1–7
                                  on the three interrupt request lines; all lines negated indicates no interrupt request.
                                  Interrupt requests arriving at the processor do not force immediate exception processing,
                                  but the requests are made pending. Pending interrupts are detected between instruction
                                  executions. If the priority of the pending interrupt is lower than or equal to the current
                                  processor priority, execution continues with the next instruction, and the interrupt
                                  exception processing is postponed until the priority of the pending interrupt becomes
                                  greater than the current processor priority.

                                  If the priority of the pending interrupt is greater than the current processor priority, the
                                  exception processing sequence is started. A copy of the status register is saved; the
                                  privilege mode is set to supervisor mode; tracing is suppressed; and the processor priority
                                  level is set to the level of the interrupt being acknowledged. The processor fetches the
                                  vector number from the interrupting device by executing an interrupt acknowledge cycle,
                                  which displays the level number of the interrupt being acknowledged on the address bus.
                                  If external logic requests an automatic vector, the processor internally generates a vector
                                  number corresponding to the interrupt level number. If external logic indicates a bus error,
                                  the interrupt is considered spurious, and the generated vector number references the
                                  spurious interrupt vector. The processor then proceeds with the usual exception
                                  processing, saving the format/offset word (MC68010 only), program counter, and status

                                                                     Go to: www.freescale.com

                                  register on the supervisor stack. The offset value in the format/offset word on the
                                  MC68010 is the vector number multiplied by four. The format is all zeros. The saved value
                                  of the program counter is the address of the instruction that would have been executed
                                  had the interrupt not been taken. The appropriate interrupt vector is fetched and loaded
                                  into the program counter, and normal instruction execution commences in the interrupt
                                  handling routine. Priority level 7 is a special case. Level 7 interrupts cannot be inhibited by
                                  the interrupt priority mask, thus providing a "nonmaskable interrupt" capability. An interrupt
                                  is generated each time the interrupt request level changes from some lower level to level
                                  7. A level 7 interrupt may still be caused by the level comparison if the request level is a 7
                                  and the processor priority is set to a lower level by an instruction.

                                  (AVEC), or bus error (BERR) during an interrupt acknowledge cycle by the MC68000. If
                                  the vector register has not been initialized, the responding M68000 Family peripheral
                                  provides vector number 15, the uninitialized interrupt vector. This response conforms to a
                                  uniform way to recover from a programming error.

                                  6.3.4 Spurious Interrupt
                                  During the interrupt acknowledge cycle, if no device responds by asserting DTACK or
                                  AVEC, VPA, BERR should be asserted to terminate the vector acquisition. The processor
                                  separates the processing of this error from bus error by forming a short format exception
                                  stack and fetching the spurious interrupt vector instead of the bus error vector. The
                                  processor then proceeds with the usual exception processing.

                                  6.3.5 Instruction Traps
                                  Traps are exceptions caused by instructions; they occur when a processor recognizes an
                                  abnormal condition during instruction execution or when an instruction is executed that
                                  normally traps during execution.

                                  Exception processing for traps is straightforward. The status register is copied; the
                                  supervisor mode is entered; and tracing is turned off. The vector number is internally
                                  generated; for the TRAP instruction, part of the vector number comes from the instruction
                                  itself. The format/offset word (MC68010 only), the program counter, and the copy of the
                                  status register are saved on the supervisor stack. The offset value in the format/offset
                                  word on the MC68010 is the vector number multiplied by four. The saved value of the
                                  program counter is the address of the instruction following the instruction that generated
                                  the trap. Finally, instruction execution commences at the address in the exception vector.

                                  Some instructions are used specifically to generate traps. The TRAP instruction always
                                  forces an exception and is useful for implementing system calls for user programs. The
                                  TRAPV and CHK instructions force an exception if the user program detects a run-time
                                  error, which may be an arithmetic overflow or a subscript out of bounds.

                                  A signed divide (DIVS) or unsigned divide (DIVU) instruction forces an exception if a
                                  division operation is attempted with a divisor of zero.

                                  6.3.6 Illegal and Unimplemented Instructions
                                  Illegal instruction is the term used to refer to any of the word bit patterns that do not match
                                  the bit pattern of the first word of a legal M68000 instruction. If such an instruction is
                                  fetched, an illegal instruction exception occurs. Motorola reserves the right to define
                                  instructions using the opcodes of any of the illegal instructions. Three bit patterns always
                                  force an illegal instruction trap on all M68000-Family-compatible microprocessors. The
                                  patterns are: $4AFA, $4AFB, and $4AFC. Two of the patterns, $4AFA and $4AFB, are
                                  reserved for Motorola system products. The third pattern, $4AFC, is reserved for customer
                                  use (as the take illegal instruction trap (ILLEGAL) instruction).

                                                In addition to the previously defined illegal instruction opcodes,
                                                the MC68010 defines eight breakpoint (BKPT) instructions with
                                                the bit patterns $4848–$484F. These instructions cause the
                                                processor to enter illegal instruction exception processing as
                                                usual. However, a breakpoint acknowledge bus cycle, in which
                                                the function code lines (FC2–FC0) are high and the address
                                                lines are all low, is also executed before the stacking
                                                operations are performed. The processor does not accept or
                                                send any data during this cycle. Whether the breakpoint
                                                acknowledge cycle is terminated with a DTACK, BERR, or VPA
                                                signal, the processor continues with the illegal instruction
                                                processing. The purpose of this cycle is to provide a software
                                                breakpoint that signals to external hardware when it is
                                                executed.

                                  Word patterns with bits 15–12 equaling 1010 or 1111 are distinguished as unimplemented
                                  instructions, and separate exception vectors are assigned to these patterns to permit
                                  efficient emulation. Opcodes beginning with bit patterns equaling 1111 (line F) are
                                  implemented in the MC68020 and beyond as coprocessor instructions. These separate
                                  vectors allow the operating system to emulate unimplemented instructions in software.

                                  Exception processing for illegal instructions is similar to that for traps. After the instruction
                                  is fetched and decoding is attempted, the processor determines that execution of an illegal
                                  instruction is being attempted and starts exception processing. The exception stack frame
                                  for group 2 is then pushed on the supervisor stack, and the illegal instruction vector is
                                  fetched.

                                  6.3.7 Privilege Violations
                                  To provide system security, various instructions are privileged. An attempt to execute one
                                  of the privileged instructions while in the user mode causes an exception. The privileged
                                  instructions are as follows:

                                    AND Immediate to SR                       MOVE USP
                                    EOR Immediate to SR                       OR Immediate to SR
                                    MOVE to SR (68010 only)                   RESET
                                    MOVE from SR (68010 only)                 RTE
                                    MOVEC (68010 only)                        STOP

Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                  instructions. After the instruction is fetched and decoded and the processor determines
                                  that a privilege violation is being attempted, the processor starts exception processing.
                                  The status register is copied; the supervisor mode is entered; and tracing is turned off.
                                  The vector number is generated to reference the privilege violation vector, and the current
                                  program counter and the copy of the status register are saved on the supervisor stack. If
                                  the processor is an MC68010, the format/offset word is also saved. The saved value of
                                  the program counter is the address of the first word of the instruction causing the privilege
                                  violation. Finally, instruction execution commences at the address in the privilege violation
                                  exception vector.

                                  6.3.8 Tracing
                                  To aid in program development, the M68000 Family includes a facility to allow tracing
                                  following each instruction. When tracing is enabled, an exception is forced after each
                                  instruction is executed. Thus, a debugging program can monitor the execution of the
                                  program under test.

                                  The trace facility is controlled by the T bit in the supervisor portion of the status register. If
                                  the T bit is cleared (off), tracing is disabled and instruction execution proceeds from
                                  instruction to instruction as normal. If the T bit is set (on) at the beginning of the execution
                                  of an instruction, a trace exception is generated after the instruction is completed. If the
                                  instruction is not executed because an interrupt is taken or because the instruction is
                                  illegal or privileged, the trace exception does not occur. The trace exception also does not
                                  occur if the instruction is aborted by a reset, bus error, or address error exception. If the
                                  instruction is executed and an interrupt is pending on completion, the trace exception is
                                  processed before the interrupt exception. During the execution of the instruction, if an
                                  exception is forced by that instruction, the exception processing for the instruction
                                  exception occurs before that of the trace exception.

                                  As an extreme illustration of these rules, consider the arrival of an interrupt during the
                                  execution of a TRAP instruction while tracing is enabled. First, the trap exception is
                                  processed, then the trace exception, and finally the interrupt exception. Instruction
                                  execution resumes in the interrupt handler routine.

                                  After the execution of the instruction is complete and before the start of the next
                                  instruction, exception processing for a trace begins. A copy is made of the status register.
                                  The transition to supervisor mode is made, and the T bit of the status register is turned off,
                                  disabling further tracing. The vector number is generated to reference the trace exception
                                  vector, and the current program counter and the copy of the status register are saved on
                                  the supervisor stack. On the MC68010, the format/offset word is also saved on the
                                  supervisor stack. The saved value of the program counter is the address of the next
                                  instruction. Instruction execution commences at the address contained in the trace
                                  exception vector.

                                  6.3.9 Bus Error
                                  A bus error exception occurs when the external logic requests that a bus error be
                                  processed by an exception. The current bus cycle is aborted. The current processor
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                  activity, whether instruction or exception processing, is terminated, and the processor
                                  immediately begins exception processing. The bus error facility is identical on the all
                                  processors; however, the stack frame produced on the MC68010 contains more
                                  information. The larger stack frame supports instruction continuation, which supports
                                  virtual memory on the MC68010 processor.

                                  6.3.9.1 BUS ERROR. Exception processing for a bus error follows the usual sequence of
                                  steps. The status register is copied, the supervisor mode is entered, and tracing is turned
                                  off. The vector number is generated to refer to the bus error vector. Since the processor is
                                  fetching the instruction or an operand when the error occurs, the context of the processor
                                  is more detailed. To save more of this context, additional information is saved on the
                                  supervisor stack. The program counter and the copy of the status register are saved. The
                                  value saved for the program counter is advanced 2–10 bytes beyond the address of the
                                  first word of the instruction that made the reference causing the bus error. If the bus error
                                  occurred during the fetch of the next instruction, the saved program counter has a value in
                                  the vicinity of the current instruction, even if the current instruction is a branch, a jump, or
                                  a return instruction. In addition to the usual information, the processor saves its internal
                                  copy of the first word of the instruction being processed and the address being accessed
                                  by the aborted bus cycle. Specific information about the access is also saved: type of
                                  access (read or write), processor activity (processing an instruction), and function code
                                  outputs when the bus error occurred. The processor is processing an instruction if it is in
                                  the normal state or processing a group 2 exception; the processor is not processing an
                                  instruction if it is processing a group 0 or a group 1 exception. Figure 6-7 illustrates how
                                  this information is organized on the supervisor stack. If a bus error occurs during the last
                                  step of exception processing, while either reading the exception vector or fetching the
                                  instruction, the value of the program counter is the address of the exception vector.
                                  Although this information is not generally sufficient to effect full recovery from the bus
                                  error, it does allow software diagnosis. Finally, the processor commences instruction
                                  processing at the address in the vector. It is the responsibility of the error handler routine

                                  If a bus error occurs during the exception processing for a bus error, an address error, or
                                  a reset, the processor halts and all processing ceases. This halt simplifies the detection of
                                  a catastrophic system failure, since the processor removes itself from the system to

                                               Figure 6-8. Exception Stack Order (Bus and Address Error)

                                  The value of the saved program counter does not necessarily point to the instruction that
                                  was executing when the bus error occurred, but may be advanced by as many as five
                                  words. This incrementing is caused by the prefetch mechanism on the MC68010 that
                                  always fetches a new instruction word as each previously fetched instruction word is used.
                                  However, enough information is placed on the stack for the bus error exception handler to
                                  determine why the bus fault occurred. This additional information includes the address
                                  being accessed, the function codes for the access, whether it was a read or a write
                                  access, and the internal register included in the transfer. The fault address can be used by
                                  an operating system to determine what virtual memory location is needed so that the
                                  requested data can be brought into physical memory. The RTE instruction is used to
                                  reload the internal state of the processor at the time of the fault. The faulted bus cycle is
                                  then rerun, and the suspended instruction is completed. If the faulted bus cycle is a read-
                                  modify-write, the entire cycle is rerun, whether the fault occurred during the read or the
                                  write operation.

                                  An alternate method of handling a bus error is to complete the faulted access in software.
                                  Using this method requires the special status word, the instruction input buffer, the data
                                  input buffer, and the data output buffer image. The format of the special status word is

                                  shown in Figure 6-9. If the bus cycle is a read, the data at the fault address should be
                                  written to the images of the data input buffer, instruction input buffer, or both according to
                                  the data fetch (DF) and instruction fetch (IF) bits. * In addition, for read-modify-write cycles,
                                  the status register image must be properly set to reflect the read data if the fault occurred
                                  during the read portion of the cycle and the write operation (i.e., setting the most
                                  significant bit of the memory location) must also be performed. These operations are
                                  required because the entire read-modify-write cycle is assumed to have been completed
                                  by software. Once the cycle has been completed by software, the rerun (RR) bit in the
                                  special status word is set to indicate to the processor that it should not rerun the cycle
                                  when the RTE instruction is executed. If the RR bit is set when an RTE instruction
                                  executes, the MC68010 reads all the information from the stack, as usual.

                                  6.3.10 Address Error
                                  An address error exception occurs when the processor attempts to access a word or long-
                                  word operand or an instruction at an odd address. An address error is similar to an
                                  internally generated bus error. The bus cycle is aborted, and the processor ceases current
                                  processing and begins exception processing. The exception processing sequence is the
                                  same as that for a bus error, including the information to be stacked, except that the
                                  vector number refers to the address error vector. Likewise, if an address error occurs
                                  during the exception processing for a bus error, address error, or reset, the processor is
                                  halted.

                                  On the MC68010, the address error exception stacks the same information stacked by a
                                  bus error exception. Therefore, the RTE instruction can be used to continue execution of
                                  the suspended instruction. However, if the RR flag is not set, the fault address is used
                                  when the cycle is retried, and another address error exception occurs. Therefore, the user
                                  must be certain that the proper corrections have been made to the stack image and user
                                  registers before attempting to continue the instruction. With proper software handling, the
                                  address error exception handler could emulate word or long-word accesses to odd
                                  addresses if desired.

                                  * If the faulted access was a byte operation, the data should be moved from or to the least significant byte of
                                  the data output or input buffer images, unless the high-byte transfer (HB) bit is set. This condition occurs if a

                                  6.4 RETURN FROM EXCEPTION (MC68010)
                                  In addition to returning from any exception handler routine on the MC68010, the RTE
                                  instruction resumes the execution of a suspended instruction by returning to the normal
                                  processing state after restoring all of the temporary register and control information stored
                                  during a bus error. For the RTE instruction to execute properly, the stack must contain
                                  valid and accessible data. The RTE instruction checks for data validity in two ways. First,
                                  the format/offset word is checked for a valid stack format code. Second, if the format code
                                  indicates the long stack format, the validity of the long stack data is checked as it is loaded
                                  into the processor. In addition, the data is checked for accessibility when the processor
                                  starts reading the long data. Because of these checks, the RTE instruction executes as
                                  follows:
                                     1. Determine the stack format. This step is the same for any stack format and consists
                                        of reading the status register, program counter, and format/offset word. If the format
Freescale Semiconductor, Inc...




                                        code indicates a short stack format, execution continues at the new program counter
                                        address. If the format code is not an MC68010-defined stack format code, exception
                                        processing starts for a format error.
                                     2. Determine data validity. For a long-stack format, the MC68010 begins to read the
                                        remaining stack data, checking for validity of the data. The only word checked for
                                        validity is the first of the 16 internal information words (SP + 26) shown in Figure 5-8.
                                        This word contains a processor version number (in bits 10–13) and proprietary
                                        internal information that must match the version number of the MC68010 attempting
                                        to read the data. This validity check is used to ensure that the data is properly
                                        interpreted by the RTE instruction. If the version number is incorrect for this
                                        processor, the RTE instruction is aborted and exception processing begins for a
                                        format error exception. Since the stack pointer is not updated until the RTE
                                        instruction has successfully read all the stack data, a format error occurring at this
                                        point does not stack new data over the previous bus error stack information.
                                     3. Determine data accessibility. If the long-stack data is valid, the MC68010 performs a
                                        read from the last word (SP + 56) of the long stack to determine data accessibility. If
                                        this read is terminated normally, the processor assumes that the remaining words on
                                        the stack frame are also accessible. If a bus error is signaled before or during this
                                        read, a bus error exception is taken. After this read, the processor must be able to
                                        load the remaining data without receiving a bus error; therefore, if a bus error occurs
                                        on any of the remaining stack reads, the error becomes a double bus fault, and the
                                        MC68010 enters the halted state.

                                  8-BIT INSTRUCTION EXECUTION TIMES
                                  This section contains listings of the instruction execution times in terms of external clock
                                  (CLK) periods for the MC68008 and MC68HC001/MC68EC000 in 8-bit mode. In this data,
                                  it is assumed that both memory read and write cycles consist of four clock periods. A
                                  longer memory cycle causes the generation of wait states that must be added to the total
                                  instruction times.

                                  The number of bus read and write cycles for each instruction is also included with the
                                  timing data. This data is shown as

                                                                             n(r/w)

                                  where:

                                    n is the total number of clock periods
                                    r is the number of read cycles
                                    w is the number of write cycles

                                  For example, a timing number shown as 18(3/1) means that 18 clock periods are required
                                  to execute the instruction. Of the 18 clock periods, 12 are used for the three read cycles
                                  (four periods per cycle). Four additional clock periods are used for the single write cycle,
                                  for a total of 16 clock periods. The bus is idle for two clock periods during which the
                                  processor completes the internal operations required for the instruction.

                                                                             NOTE
                                               The total number of clock periods (n) includes instruction fetch
                                               and all applicable operand fetches and stores.

                                  The numbers of clock periods shown in Table 7-5 indicate the times required to perform
                                  the operations, store the results, and read the next instruction. The total number of clock
                                  periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles are shown in the
                                  previously described format. The number of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and
                                  the number of write cycles, respectively, must be added to those of the effective address
                                  calculation where indicated by a plus sign (+).

                                  This section contains listings of the instruction execution times in terms of external clock
                                  (CLK) periods for the MC68000, MC68HC000, MC68HC001, and the MC68EC000 in 16-

                                  added to the total instruction times.

                                  The number of bus read and write cycles for each instruction is also included with the
                                  timing data. This data is shown as

                                                                              n(r/w)

                                  where:
                                    n is the total number of clock periods
                                    r is the number of read cycles
                                    w is the number of write cycles

                                  For example, a timing number shown as 18(3/1) means that the total number of clock
                                  periods is 18. Of the 18 clock periods, 12 are used for the three read cycles (four periods
                                  per cycle). Four additional clock periods are used for the single write cycle, for a total of 16
                                  clock periods. The bus is idle for two clock periods during which the processor completes

                                                                              NOTE
                                                The total number of clock periods (n) includes instruction fetch
                                                and all applicable operand fetches and stores.

                                  Table 8-1 lists the numbers of clock periods required to compute the effective addresses
                                  for instructions. The total includes fetching any extension words, computing the address,
                                  and fetching the memory operand. The total number of clock periods, the number of read
                                  cycles, and the number of write cycles (zero for all effective address calculations) are

                                  8.3 STANDARD INSTRUCTION EXECUTION TIMES
                                  The numbers of clock periods shown in Table 8-4 indicate the times required to perform
                                  the operations, store the results, and read the next instruction. The total number of clock
                                  periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles are shown in the
                                  previously described format. The number of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and
                                  the number of write cycles, respectively, must be added to those of the effective address
                                  calculation where indicated by a plus sign (+).

                                  In Table 8-4, the following notation applies:
                                     An    —      Address register operand
                                     Dn    —      Data register operand
                                     ea    —      An operand specified by an effective address
                                     M     —      Memory effective address operand

                                  operands, perform the operations, store the results, and read the next operation. The total
                                  number of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles are
                                  shown in the previously described format. The number of clock periods, the number of
                                  read cycles, and the number of write cycles, respectively, must be added to those of the
                                  effective address calculation where indicated by a plus sign (+).

                                  In Table 8-5, the following notation applies:
                                    #    —   Immediate operand

                                  This section contains listings of the instruction execution times in terms of external clock
                                  (CLK) periods for the MC68010. In this data, it is assumed that both memory read and
                                  write cycles consist of four clock periods. A longer memory cycle causes the generation of
                                  wait states that must be added to the total instruction times.

                                  The number of bus read and write cycles for each instruction is also included with the
                                  timing data. This data is shown as

                                                                             n(r/w)

                                  where:
                                    n is the total number of clock periods
                                    r is the number of read cycles
                                    w is the number of write cycles

                                  For example, a timing number shown as 18(3/1) means that 18 clock cycles are required
                                  to execute the instruction. Of the 18 clock periods, 12 are used for the three read cycles
                                  (four periods per cycle). Four additional clock periods are used for the single write cycle,
                                  for a total of 16 clock periods. The bus is idle for two clock periods during which the
                                  processor completes the internal operations required for the instructions.

                                                                             NOTE
                                               The total number of clock periods (n) includes instruction fetch
                                               and all applicable operand fetches and stores.

                                  Tables 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, and 9-5 list the numbers of clock periods for the move instructions.
                                  The totals include instruction fetch, operand reads, and operand writes. The total number
                                  of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles are shown in
                                  the previously described format.

                                  9.3 STANDARD INSTRUCTION EXECUTION TIMES
                                  The numbers of clock periods shown in tables 9-6 and 9-7 indicate the times required to
                                  perform the operations, store the results, and read the next instruction. The total number
                                  of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles are shown in
                                  the previously described format. The number of clock periods, the number of read cycles,
                                  and the number of write cycles, respectively, must be added to those of the effective
                                  address calculation where indicated by a plus sign (+).

                                  In Tables 9-6 and 9-7, the following notation applies:
                                     An     —    Address register operand
                                     Sn     —    Data register operand
                                     ea     —    An operand specified by an effective address
                                     M      —    Memory effective address operand

                                  9.4 IMMEDIATE INSTRUCTION EXECUTION TIMES
                                  The numbers of clock periods shown in Table 9-8 include the times to fetch immediate
                                  operands, perform the operations, store the results, and read the next operation. The total
                                  number of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles are
                                  shown in the previously described format. The number of clock periods, the number of
                                  read cycles, and the number of write cycles, respectively, must be added to those of the
                                  effective address calculation where indicated by a plus sign (+).

                                  In Tables 9-8, the following notation applies:
                                    #    —   Immediate operand
                                    Dn   —   Data register operand
                                    An   —   Address register operand

                                  Table 9-19 lists the timing data for exception processing. The numbers of clock periods
                                  include the times for all stacking, the vector fetch, and the fetch of the first instruction of
                                  the handler routine. The total number of clock periods, the number of read cycles, and the
                                  number of write cycles are shown in the previously described format. The number of clock
                                  periods, the number of read cycles, and the number of write cycles, respectively, must be
                                  added to those of the effective address calculation where indicated by a plus sign (+).

                                  The average die-junction temperature, TJ, in °C can be obtained from:

                                    TJ = T A+(PD • θJA)                                                                   (1)
                                  where:

                                    TA      = Ambient Temperature, °C
                                    θJ

                                    PD      = PINT + PI/O
                                    PINT = ICC x VCC, Watts — Chip Internal Power

                                  For most applications, P I/O<PINT and can be neglected.

                                  An appropriate relationship between P D and T J (if P I/O is neglected) is:

                                    PD = K÷(TJ + 273 °C)                                                                  (2)
                                  Solving Equations (1) and (2) for K gives:

                                       K = P D • (TA + 273°C) + θ JA • P D2                                               (3)
                                  where K is a constant pertaining to the particular part. K can be determined from equation
                                  (3) by measuring P D (at thermal equilibrium) for a known TA. Using this value of K, the
                                  values of PD and T J can be obtained by solving Equations (1) and (2) iteratively for any
                                  value of T A.

                                  The curve shown in Figure 10-1 gives the graphic solution to the above equations for the
                                  specified power dissipation of 1.5 W over the ambient temperature range of -55 °C to 125
                                  °C using a maximum θ J A of 45 °C/W. Ambient temperature is that of the still air
                                  surrounding the device. Lower values of θJA cause the curve to shift downward slightly; for
                                  instance, for θJA of 40 °/W, the curve is just below 1.4 W at 25 °C.

                                   The total thermal resistance of a package (θ JA) can be separated into two components,
                                  θJ
                                    C and θCA, representing the barrier to heat flow from the semiconductor junction to the
                                  package (case) surface ( θJC ) and from the case to the outside ambient air (θ CA). These
                                  terms are related by the equation:
                                       θJ
                                      A = θ JC + θCA                                                                 (4)
                                  θJ
                                    C is device related and cannot be influenced by the user. However, θ CA is user
                                  dependent and can be minimized by such thermal management techniques as heat sinks,
                                  ambient air cooling, and thermal convection. Thus, good thermal management on the part
                                  of the user can significantly reduce θCA so that θ J A approximately equals ; θJC .
                                  Substitution of θJC for θ J A in equation 1 results in a lower semiconductor junction
                                  temperature.

                                   Table 10-1 summarizes maximum power dissipation and average junction temperature
                                  for the curve drawn in Figure 10-1, using the minimum and maximum values of ambient
                                  temperature for different packages and substituting θJC for θ JA (assuming good thermal
                                  management). Table 10-2 provides the maximum power dissipation and average junction
                                  temperature assuming that no thermal management is applied (i.e., still air).

                                                                                               NOTE
                                               Since the power dissipation curve shown in Figure 10-1 is
                                               negatively sloped, power dissipation declines as ambient
                                               temperature increases.         Therefore, maximum power
                                               dissipation occurs at the lowest rated ambient temperature, but
                                               the highest average junction temperature occurs at the
                                               maximum ambient temperature where power dissipation is

                                  10.4 CMOS CONSIDERATIONS
                                  The MC68HC000, MC68HC001, and MC68EC000, with it significantly lower power
                                  consumption, has other considerations. The CMOS cell is basically composed of two
                                  complementary transistors (a P channel and an N channel), and only one transistor is
                                  turned on while the cell is in the steady state. The active P-channel transistor sources
                                  current when the output is a logic high and presents a high impedance when the output is
                                  logic low. Thus, the overall result is extremely low power consumption because no power

                                                              For More Information On This Product,
                                                                       Go to: www.freescale.com
                                                          Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.

                                  is lost through the active P-channel transistor. Also, since only one transistor is turned on
                                  during the steady state, power consumption is determined by leakage currents.

                                  Because the basic CMOS cell is composed of two complementary transistors, a virtual
                                  semiconductor controlled rectifier (SCR) may be formed when an input exceeds the
                                  supply voltage. The SCR that is formed by this high input causes the device to become
                                  latched in a mode that may result in excessive current drain and eventual destruction of
                                  the device. Although the MC68HC000 and MC68EC000 is implemented with input
                                  protection diodes, care should be exercised to ensure that the maximum input voltage
                                  specification is not exceeded. Some systems may require that the CMOS circuitry be
                                  isolated from voltage transients; other may require additional circuitry.

                                  The MC68HC000 and MC68EC000, implemented in CMOS, is applicable to designs to
                                  which the following considerations are relevant:

                                    1. The MC68HC000 and MC68EC000 completely satisfies the input/output drive
                                        requirements of CMOS logic devices.
                                    2. The HCMOS MC68HC000 and MC68EC000 provides an order of magnitude
                                        reduction in power dissipation when compared to the HMOS MC68000. However,
                                        the MC68HC000 does not offer a "power-down" mode.

                                  10.5 AC ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATION DEFINITIONS
                                  The AC specifications presented consist of output delays, input setup and hold times, and
                                  signal skew times. All signals are specified relative to an appropriate edge of the clock and
                                  possibly to one or more other signals.

                                  The measurement of the AC specifications is defined by the waveforms shown in Figure
                                  10-2. To test the parameters guaranteed by Motorola, inputs must be driven to the voltage
                                  levels specified in the figure. Outputs are specified with minimum and/or maximum limits,
                                  as appropriate, and are measured as shown. Inputs are specified with minimum setup and
                                  hold times, and are measured as shown. Finally, the measurement for signal-to-signal
                                  specifications are shown.

                                                                             NOTE
                                                The testing levels used to verify conformance to the AC
                                                specifications does not affect the guaranteed DC operation of
                                                the device as specified in the DC electrical characteristics.

                                  NOTES:
                                       1. For a loading capacitance of less than or equal to 50 pF, subtract 5 ns from the value given in the maximum
                                          columns.
                                       2. Actual value depends on clock period.
                                       3. If #47 is satisfied for both DTACK and BERR , #48 may be ignored. In the absence of DTACK , BERR is an
                                          asynchronous input using the asynchronous input setup time (#47).
                                       4. For power-up, the MC68000 must be held in the reset state for 100 ms to allow stabilization of on-chip
                                          circuitry. After the system is powered up, #56 refers to the minimum pulse width required to reset the
                                          processor.
                                       5. If the asynchronous input setup time (#47) requirement is satisfied for DTACK, the DTACK asserted to data
                                          setup time (#31) requirement can be ignored. The data must only satisfy the data-in to clock low setup time
                                          (#27) for the following clock cycle.
                                       6. When AS and R/W are equally loaded (±20;pc), subtract 5 ns from the values given in these columns.
                                       7. The processor will negate BG and begin driving the bus again if external arbitration logic negates BR before
                                          asserting BGACK.
                                       8. The minimum value must be met to guarantee proper operation. If the maximum value is exceeded, BG may
                                          be reasserted.
                                       9. The falling edge of S6 triggers both the negation of the strobes ( AS and DS ) and the falling edge of E. Either
                                          of these events can occur first, depending upon the loading on each signal. Specification #49 indicates the
                                          absolute maximum skew that will occur between the rising edge of the strobes and the falling edge of E.
                                       10. 245 ns for the MC68008.
                                       11. 50 ns for the MC68008
                                       12. 50 ns for the MC68008.

                                            next falling edge of the clock.
                                         2. BR need fall at this time only to insure being recognized at the end of the bus cycle.
                                         3. Timing measurements are referenced to and from a low voltage of 0.8 V and a high voltage of 2.0 V,
                                            unless otherwise noted. The voltage swing through this range should start outside and pass through the
                                            range such that the rise or fall is linear between 0.8 V and 2.0 V.

                                             1. Timing measurements are referenced to and from a low voltage of 0.8 V and a high voltage of 2.0 V,
                                          unless otherwise noted. The voltage swing through this range should start outside and pass through the
                                          range such that the rise or fall is linear between 0.8 V and 2.0 V.
                                          2. Because of loading variations, R/W may be valid after AS even though both are initiated by the rising edge
                                          of S2 (specification #20A).

                                  NOTES:    1. For a loading capacitance of less than or equal to 50 pF, subtract 5 ns from the value given in the

                                               Either of these events can occur first, depending upon the loading on each signal. Specificaton

                                  *These specifications represent improvement over previously published specifications for the 8-, 10-, and 12.5-MHz
                                   MC68000 and are valid only for product bearing date codes of 8827 and later.
                                  ** Applies only to the MC68HC000 and MC68HC001.
                                  NOTES:
                                       1. Setup time for the synchronous inputs BGACK, IPL0-IPL2 , and VPA guarantees their recognition at the
                                          next falling edge of the clock.
                                       2. BR need fall at this time only in order to insure being recognized at the end of the bus cycle.
                                       3. Timing measurements are referenced to and from a low voltage of 0.8 volt and a high voltage of 2.0 volts,
                                          unless otherwise noted. The voltage swing through this range should start outside and pass through the
                                          range such that the rise or fall will be lienar between 0.8 volt and 2.0 volts.
                                       4. The processor will negate BG and begin driving the bus again if external arbitration logic negates BR before
                                          asserting BGACK.
                                       5. The minimum value must be met to guarantee proper operation. If the maximum value is exceeded, BG may
                                          be reasserted.

                                  NOTES:1. For a loading capacitance of less than or equal to 50 pF, subtract 5 ns from the value given in the
                                             maximum columns.
                                        2. Actual value depends on clock period.
                                        3.I f #47 is satisfied for both DTACK and BERR , #48 may be ignored. In the absence of DTACK, BERR is an
                                             asynchronous input using the asynchronous input setup time (#47).
                                         4. For power-up, the MC68EC000 must be held in the reset state for 520 clocks to allow stabilization of on-
                                             chip circuitry. After the system is powered up, #56 refers to the minimum pulse width required to
                                             reset the processor.
                                         5. If the asynchronous input setup time (#47) requirement is satisfied for DTACK, the DTACK -asserted to data
                                             setup time (#31) requirement can be ignored. The data must only satisfy the data-in to clock low
                                             setup time (#27) for the following clock cycle.
                                         6. When AS and R/W are equally loaded (±20;pc), subtract 5 ns from the values given in these columns.
                                         7. The minimum value must be met to guarantee proper operation. If the maximum value is exceeded,
                                             BG may be reasserted.

                                          NOTES:
                                           1. Setup time for the asynchronous inputs IPL2–IPL0 and AVEC (#47) guarantees their recognition at the
                                              next falling edge of the clock.
                                           2. BR need fall at this time only to insure being recognized at the end of the bus cycle.
                                           3. Timing measurements are referenced to and from a low voltage of 0.8 V and a high voltage of 2.0 V,
                                              unless otherwise noted. The voltage swing through this range should start outside and pass through the
                                              range such that the rise or fall is linear between 0.8 V and 2.0 V.

                                  MC68010 LOOP MODE OPERATION
                                  In the loop mode of the MC68010, a single instruction is executed repeatedly under
                                  control of the test condition, decrement, and branch (DBcc) instruction without any
                                  instruction fetch bus cycles. The execution of a single-instruction loop without fetching an
                                  instruction provides a highly efficient means of repeating an instruction because the only
                                  bus cycles required are those that read and write the operands.

                                  The DBcc instruction uses three operands: a loop counter, a branch condition, and a
                                  branch displacement. When this instruction is executed in the loop mode, the value in the
                                  low-order word of the register specified as the loop counter is decremented by one and
                                  compared to minus one. If the result after decrementing the value is equal to minus one,
                                  the result is placed in the loop counter, and the next instruction in sequence is executed.
                                  Otherwise, the condition code register is checked against the specified branch condition. If
                                  the branch condition is true, the result is discarded, and the next instruction in sequence is
                                  executed. When the count is not equal to minus one and the branch condition is false, the
                                  branch displacement is added to the value in the program counter, and the instruction at
                                  the resulting address is executed.

                                  Figure A-1 shows the source code of a program fragment containing a loop that executes
                                  in the loop mode in the MC68010. The program moves a block of data at address
                                  SOURCE to a block starting at address DEST. The number of words in the block is
                                  labeled LENGTH. If any word in the block at address SOURCE contains zero, the move
                                  operation stops, and the program performs whatever processing follows this program
                                  fragment.

                                  The first load effective address (LEA) instruction loads the address labeled SOURCE into
                                  address register A0. The second instruction, also an LEA instruction, loads the address
                                  labeled DEST into address register A1. Next, a move data from source to destination
                                  (MOVE) instruction moves the number of words into data register D0, the loop counter.
                                  The last two instructions, a MOVE and a test equal, decrement, and branch (DBEQ), form
                                  the loop that moves the block of data. The bus activity required to execute these
                                  instructions consists of the following cycles:

                                                                   Go to: www.freescale.com

                                    1.   Fetch the MOVE instruction.
                                    2.   Fetch the DBEQ instruction.
                                    3.   Read the operand at the address in A0.
                                    4.   Write the operand at the address in A1.
                                    5.   Fetch the displacement word of the DBEQ instruction.

                                  Of these five bus cycles, only two move the data. However, the MC68010 has a two-word
                                  prefetch queue in addition to the one-word instruction decode register. The loop mode
                                  uses the prefetch queue and the instruction decode register to eliminate the instruction
                                  fetch cycles. The processor places the MOVE instruction in the instruction decode register
                                  and the two words of the DBEQ instruction in the prefetch queue. With no additional
                                  opcode fetches, the processor executes these two instructions as required to move the
                                  entire block or to move all nonzero words that precede a zero.

                                  The MC68010 enters the loop mode automatically when the conditions for loop mode
                                  operation are met. Entering the loop mode is transparent to the programmer. The
                                  conditions are that the loop count and branch condition of the DBcc instruction must result
                                  in looping, the branch displacement must be minus four, and the branch must be to a one-
                                  word loop mode instruction preceding the DBcc instruction. The looped instruction and the
                                  first word of the DBcc instruction are each fetched twice when the loop is entered. When
                                  the processor fetches the looped instruction the second time and determines that the
                                  looped instruction is a loop mode instruction, the processor automatically enters the loop
                                  mode, and no more instruction fetches occur until the count is exhausted or the loop
                                  condition is true.

                                  In addition to the normal termination conditions for the loop, several abnormal conditions
                                  cause the MC68010 to exit the loop mode. These abnormal conditions are as follows:
                                    • Interrupts
                                    • Trace Exceptions
                                    • Reset Operations
                                    • Bus Errors

                                  Any pending interrupt is taken after each execution of the DBcc instruction, but not after
                                  each execution of the looped instruction. Taking an interrupt exception terminates the loop
                                  mode operation; loop mode operation can be restarted on return from the interrupt
                                  handler. While the T bit is set, a trace exception occurs at the end of both the looped
                                  instruction and the DBcc instruction, making loop mode unavailable while tracing is
                                  enabled. A reset operation aborts all processing, including loop mode processing. A bus
                                  error during loop mode operation is handled the same as during other processing;
                                  however, when the return from exception (RTE) instruction continues execution of the
                                  looped instruction, the three-word loop is not fetched again.

                                  Table A-1 lists the loop mode instructions of the MC68010. Only one-word versions of
                                  these instructions can operate in the loop mode. One-word instructions use the three
                                  address register indirect modes: (An), (An)+, and –(An).
